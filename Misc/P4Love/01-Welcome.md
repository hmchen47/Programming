## 0.1 Course Information

I am so happy that you're going to join me for my course, Programming for Lovers.  The course starts on October 14, with lectures on Monday and Thursday evenings ET (they will be recorded if you want to join us at your own pace).  It runs for nine weeks and I am donating up to $2,500 to charity; see Charitable Contribution Disclosure for more details.  I will provide information about how the course will operate when the course begins.

I have found in my own students that exposure to programming is at an all-time high.  But many of the online materials teaching programming are not as rigorous as a course at an institution like Carnegie Mellon University, where I work.  Sometimes, offline programming courses are rigorous, but they get mired in technical details (such as the implementation details of a language) and miss the critical fact that programming is supposed to be fun.

In order to be fun, this course will teach programming by constantly pointing to practical topics. Here is a sampling of what we will start with; some of these topics show how computation has revolutionized biology, and some are taken from other practical disciplines.  There will be bonus topics too!  But I want to keep them a surprise.

1. Prologue: The Ancient Greeks and the Origins of Computational Thinking
2. Hunting for Replication Origins in Bacterial Genomes
3. Monte Carlo Simulation and Hacking the 2016 US Presidential Election
4. Top-Down Programming and Building a Self-Replicating Automaton
5. Object-Oriented Programming 1: Building a Physics Engine Simulating Gravity
6. Object-Oriented Programming 2: Constructing the Tree of Life

The language that we will use is [Go](http://golang.org/) (hence the Gophers in love, which is a modification of Renee French's work).  Go is a very nice language with some powerful features; we will  get to see how it makes parallel programming a breeze, for example. But much of what we will learn in this course is not confined to a specific language.
