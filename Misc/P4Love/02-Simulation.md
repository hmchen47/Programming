## 2.1 Polling data and Statistics

+ 538 and NY Times Projections in 2016
  + Note: Projections fluctuate but have same shape

+ Polling data inherently volatile
  + __Margin of Error:__ percentage value on either side of polling percentage within which we have confidence in the poll (here it's 4%)

+ The US Presidential election uses an "electoral college"

Red denotes states won by Trump and blue denotes those won by Clinton. Numbers indicate the number of electoral votes allocated to each state plus the District of Columbia, and show for whom they were cast. Altogether, Trump garnered 304 electoral votes and Clinton 227, as seven faithless electors, two pledged to Trump and five pledged to Clinton, voted for other persons." title="Presidential election results map" width=350>

+ Idea: simulate election many times from state polling data

+ Monte Carlo simulation everywhere
  + __Monte Carlo Simulation:__ repeatedly running random simulations to obtain an approximate result
  + eg, stock price, weather forecast, sporting events,
