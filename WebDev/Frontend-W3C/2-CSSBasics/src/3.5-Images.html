       Here is an image that is unformatted, so the surrounding text directly touches it.

       It also doesn't integrate well with the text content, so it does not flow with your other content.

      One thing that can make a website look cohesive is to choose images that match the design's existing color pallett. Sometimes this can be difficult if you have a lot of content images with lots of colors, but whenever possible try to match images to the colors surrounding it.

      Here is a group of images in a grid, similar to how you would want to display them in a gallery. You can see how important it is to add proper white space around the images. In this case we have added padding, a border as well as margin to give the images a nice flow. There is also a good spacing between the images and the text.

      <p> Here is some body text that is now on top of an image because it is set as the background. When using an image as a background try to pick an image that is not overly busy, this can make your text or other images difficult to read when placed on top of.
