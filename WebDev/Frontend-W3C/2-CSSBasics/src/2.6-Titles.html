        Font is an extremely important part of how you communicate content to your user. As you are likely aware there are many different aspects to font, and with CSS you can explicitly style each aspect. This property sets the font face. There are a collection of Web safe fonts that generally each browser has agreed to support, but there is an infinite number of different fonts. The problem is they might not all look the way you want them to on different browsers.

      Color is one of the first things you'll want to explore when designing your website. Thankfully CSS provides a wide array of tools for you to control the color of different HTML elements. There are two basic color properties color and background color.

    <div id="design2">
    <h1> Title to a web page 2 </h1>
    <p>
      This property sets the foreground color of an element's text content. By default, all text content will be set to black. If you set the color on one HTML element it will be inherited by all HTML elements within that. For example, if you set the color property on the body tag to blue, all text on your web page will be changed to blue, unless that text has a more specific color property that will override it.

    <div id="design3">
    <h1> Title to a web page 3 </h1>
    <p>
      This property sets the background color of an element. This color then represents the exact space the element takes up, which is always a rectangular area. The default value is 'transparent' which means whatever is behind the element will shine through. Note that background-color is one example of a property that is not inherited, so you will have to directly set the background-color on each element. To set the overall color of your page apply a background color to the body tag, and since all other element's background colors will be transparent by default it will appear as if everything has that same background color.
