### A world of possibilities

In Module 1, we learned the basics of HTML5. It's a fairly simple format, just a tree full of elements, which are described by tags, attributes, and the content inside the tags; the rest is details.

Once you know the list of all the possible tags, the list of available attributes, and a few special cases like the Document Type Declaration (DTD), self-closing tags, and meta tags, then you will have the foundation to code in HTML5.

Putting this all together to form a coherent Web page with the addition of CSS presents a world of possibilities. In this module, we'll delve into some of those interesting possibilities.


## 5.2 Tables

### Introduction to tables

Using tables to organize information goes back a ways.  A long ways. Three or four thousand years ago, Sumerians were using [tables to calculate compound interest](http://www.storyofmathematics.com/sumerian.html).  Even so, tables are not obsolete, in fact HTML5 includes extensive facilities for describing/building tables.

Tables are used to arrange data in tabular format - rows and columns of cells. You can put a variety of data like text, images, forms, links and even other tables in your table.

You may hear experienced Web developers decrying the use of tables, giving the impression that tables should be avoided at all costs.  It might seem off-putting at first, but they're not really talking about using tables for tabular information.  In earlier days, when layout options were limited, many developers resorted to tables as a means of layout.  There's really no need to do that anymore, there are plenty of layout capabilities in CSS3.  You really don't want to use tables that way, but there absolutely nothing wrong with using them for their intended purpose - making tables.

#### Separating content and style

Look at [this site](http://create.adobe.com/) that is laid out with CSS. You might be tempted to do this via tables instead. Or you might want to just make your whole Web page into one big table: site header in a table row, left navigation bar on the second row, left column, etc.

Bad idea! Here's why:

+ They are semantically incorrect for layout because they represent presentation and not content.
+ It puts presentation data in your content making your HTML larger. The user must download this unnecessary presentation data for every page they visit.
+ Accessibility: tables are not very screen reader friendly. Using tables for layout will clutter your HTML making it harder for assistive technology to parse your Web page.
+ Redesigns are harder when your HTML is cluttered with presentational code that should go into CSS. To change the layout of the page, you shouldn't be editing your content. Instead, you should just have to make CSS related changes.
+ Using CSS (one or two external stylesheets for your whole Web site) is easier to maintain consistency among pages.

Tables were not intended as a layout tool, so it is best to stick to them only for tabular data.

#### Table elements

Here is a list of all the  table elements we will be learning in this section:

| Type | Element |
|------|:---------:|
| Table | `<table>` |
| Caption | `<caption>` |
| Row groups | `<thead>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tbody>` |
| Column groups | `<colgroup>`, `<col>` |
| Table row | `<tr>` |
| Table cells | `<th>`, `<td>` |

We will use these elements to build our table as we go.

#### The table tag

This tag defines a table in HTML5.

Attribute:

+ border - has two values, 0 and 1. It is used to specify a border around table cells. 0 - no border, 1 - add border. 0 also suggests that it is a layout table.

Other attributes have been deprecated as the same can be achieved through CSS.

```html
<table border=1></table>
```

The code above will not provide any major visual change to your website yet because we don't have any cells defined.

Note: Though there is an attribute for border, the table elements should be styled using CSS. You can use the CSS border property to do that instead.

#### The caption tag

It is used to give a title to the table and should be used as the first child element of `<table>`. It can be used to provide more context to the table if its content is ambiguous. As a summary of the table content, a caption can also be helpful for people who have difficulty understanding the content or use assistive technology.

```html
<table border=1>
  <caption>
    <p>Table 1.0</p>
    <p>Student's final exam results 2016</p>
  </caption>
</table>
```


### The tr, th, td, colgroup, col tags

Let's now create the most basic table with a few cells.

#### The tr tag

Creates a table row.

#### The th tag

There are two types of cells in a table - header and standard. `<th>` creates table header cells. The content of table header cells is bold and centered by default.

```html
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
</table>
````

| Attributes for `<th>` | Purpose | Usage | Output |
|-----------------------|---------|-------|--------|
| `colspan` | Specifies the number of cells you want that column to span (cover) <br/> Possible values: positive integer number | `<th colspan="2">` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/xXERVo) |
| `rowspan` | Specifies the number of cells you want the row to span (cover) <br/> Possible values: positive integer number | `<th rowspan="2">` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/WZGojz) |
| `scope` | Specifies if a header cell is the header for a `row`, `column`, `rowgroup` or `colgroup` <br/> Possible values: `row`, `col`, `rowgroup`, `colgroup`, `auto` | `<th scope="row">` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/YrGpEG) |


#### The td tag

Creates table data (standard) cells. Content of table data cells is regular and left-aligned by default.

With these tags we can create a simple table.

```html
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Name</th>
    <th scope="col">Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alexa</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>James</td>
    <td>35</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

| Attributes for `<td>` | Purpose | Usage | Output |
|-----------------------|---------|-------|--------|
| `colspan` | Specifies the number of cells you want that column to span (cover) <br/> Possible values: positive integer number | `<td colspan="2">` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/zEKoRg) |
| `rowspan` | Specifies the number of cells you want the row to span (cover) <br/> Possible values: positive integer number | `<td rowspan="2">` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/PJGbeJ) |
| `headers` | Value is the 'id' of the `<th>` tag it corresponds to if any | `<tr>` <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `<th id="header-id">` <br/> `</tr>` <br/> `<tr>` <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `<td headers="header-id">` <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `<td headers="header-id">` <br/> `</tr>` | [View example](https://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/KXgNxr) |


#### The colgroup and col tags

__`<colgroup>`__

This tag allows you to group columns in a table. Grouping columns is useful if you want to specify properties for a group of columns like applying styles to the whole column instead of repeating it for each cell.

Attribute:

+ `span` - takes a positive integer value. It specifies the number of columns you want your colgroup to span (cover). The colgroup element shares its attributes like style and width with all the columns it spans.  Essentially it allows a single cell to stretch to cover multiple columns on a particular row.

__`<col>`__

Used within `<colgroup>`, the `<col>` tag specifies the column property for each column within a colgroup. The only element a `<colgroup>` can contain is `<col>`. 

Attribute:

+ `span` - takes a positive integer value. It specifies the number of columns you want the col element to span (cover).

Consider the table above we created using `<tr>`, `<th>` and `<td>`. Let's say I want the 'name' column to be in green and the 'age' column to be orange. You need to use the `<colgroup>` and `<col>` tags to achieve styling effects specific to a column.

```html
<body>
  <table border=1>
    <colgroup>
      <col span="1" style="background-color:green">
      <col span="1" style="background-color:orange">
    </colgroup>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alexa</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>James</td>
      <td>35</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
```

#### Knowledge check 5.2.1

Which of the following tags will you use to add cells to the table header?

a. < head > <br/>
b. < td > <br/>
c. < th > <br/>
d. < tr >

Ans: c <br/>
Explanation: th is for table header. th cell's content is bolded and centered by default. <br/><br/>


### The thead, tbody and tfoot tags

Similar to an HTML document, a table in HTML can be split into header, body and footer. We use these three tags - `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` - to specify parts of a table.

It is very useful to define parts of a table as header, body and footer because once browsers are able to identify which cells are header and footer, the body can be allowed to scroll independently of header and footer catering to a good table viewing experience in small screens. This is one such example. Apart from this, these elements can also be used to style header, body and footer rows individually using CSS. 

#### The thead tag

Just like how we use `<colgroup>` to group columns, `<thead>` is used to group the header content in a HTML table. 

As we learned in the previous unit, header cells are specified using `<th>` as a child of <tr>. Rows specified within `<thead>` indicate that they are header rows. See the code below:

```html
<thead style="color:white">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Name</th>
    <th scope="col">Age</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
```

#### The tbody tag

Following`<thead>`, subsequent rows are considered body rows in a table. Regular cells are specified using `<td>` as a child of `<tr>`:

```html
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Alexa</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>James</td>
    <td>35</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trisha</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
```

#### The tfoot tag

The footer is the last to be specified and rows within `<tfoot>` are considered footer rows at the end of a table:

```html
<tfoot>
  <tr>
    <td>3 Unique Name</td>
    <td>2 Unique Ages</td>
  </tr>
</tfoot>
```

Putting it all together:

<!--
```html
<table border=1>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="1" style="background-color:green">
    <col span="1" style="background-color:orange">
  </colgroup>
  <thead style="color:white">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alexa</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>James</td>
      <td>35</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trisha</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot style="font-style: italic;">
    <tr>
      <td>3 Unique Names</td>
      <td>2 Unique Ages</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
```
-->

<table border=1>
  <colgroup>
    <col span="1" style="background-color:green">
    <col span="1" style="background-color:orange">
  </colgroup>
  <thead style="color:white">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Name</th>
      <th scope="col">Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alexa</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>James</td>
      <td>35</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Trisha</td>
      <td>23</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot style="font-style: italic;">
    <tr>
      <td>3 Unique Names</td>
      <td>2 Unique Ages</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>


#### Knowledge check 5.2.2

True or False? By specifying the header, body and footer for the table, you can scroll these sections independent of each other.

Ans: True <br/>
Explication: This is typically done when you want to display a large table in a small space. The body can be allowed to scroll independently of header and footer catering to a good table viewing experience in small screens. You can achieve this using pure CSS or JavaScript. <br/><br/>


### Styling your table

We now know how to put a basic table together. However, the tables we have looked at so far could really use some work in terms of how they look.

Here, we will look at some useful CSS elements to style your table. All examples below are using CodePen. Each CodePen has three tabs - Result, HTML and CSS. Make sure to view each tab to get the HTML and CSS code for examples. You are also welcome to modify the code for each example by clicking on 'Edit on CodePen' on the top right corner of the CodePen (click on "RUN" when you completed your changes).

#### border

Though border is a valid attribute of the table element, it is best specified in CSS. It is a shorthand property meaning you can set several CSS properties simultaneously. 

The CSS border property sets border-width, border-style and border-color in order: 

```html
table { border: 1px solid black; }
```

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #0021fd; color: #ffffff;">Property Value</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #0021fd; color: #ffffff;">Possible values</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>border-width</td>
    <td>thin, medium, thick, in pixels</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>border-style</td>
    <td>none, hidden, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>border-color</td>
    <td>color name or color values, transparent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>initial</td>
    <td>sets the property to the default value. Defaults for width, style and color are 'medium none current-color-of-element'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>inherit</td>
    <td>inherits property from parent element</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To give a border to `<table>`, `<th>` and `<td>`:

```htnl
table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; }
```

<hr>
<table style="border: 1px solid black">
  <tr><th style="border: 1px solid black">Names</th><th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black">Michael</td><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style="border: thin dashed black">
  <tr><th style="border: thin dashed black">Names</th><th style="border-spacing: 25px 50px;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: thin dashed black">Michael</td><td style="border-spacing: 25px 50px;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style="border: initial">
  <tr><th style="border: initial">Names</th><th style="border-spacing: 50px 25px;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: initial">Michael</td><td style="border-spacing: 50px 25px;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<hr>


#### border-collapse

We gave a border to the table, table-header and table-data above. This creates two borders creating a double line. In order to collapse them all into a single border, we use the `border-collapse` CSS property:

```html
table { border-collapse: collapse; }
```

Possible values of this property are:

+ `separate` - default value where borders are detached like in the example above
+ `collapse` - border are collapsed into a single border
+ `initial` - sets to default value (`separate`)

<hr>
<table style="border: 1px solid black;">
  <tr><th style="border: 1px solid black;">Names</th><th style="border: 1px solid black;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Michael</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr><th style="border: 1px solid black;">Names</th><th style="border: 1px solid black;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Michael</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<hr>

#### Table width and height

Browsers automatically set the width and height for the rows and columns for your table based on the content in your cells. Cells with most content usually set the height and width of all cells adjacent to themselves. 

With CSS, you can also explicitly set the dimensions of your cells. Width and height can be specified in:

+ units of length like pixels, percentage - relative to the table width, etc
+ auto: the browser will calculate and select a width for the specified element (default value)

It also supports initial (sets property to default value) and inherit (from parent element). 

`width/height` of `<td>` of one cell will not only affect that cell but the whole column/row. If two cells in one column/row have different widths/heights specified, the _larger value_ is set.

<hr>
<p>The width of the first whole column is decided by the width of the cell with most content:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Names</th><th>Profession</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Michael Fernandez</td><td>Doctor</td></tr>  
  <tr><td>Amy Frank</td><td >Computer Engineer</td></tr>  
</table>

<p>Specifying the width for one cell will affect the whole column. Width is set in percentage relative to the whole table: (1st col = 25%)</p>
<table>
  <tr><th style="width: 25%;">Names</th><th>Profession</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Michael Fernandez</td><td>Doctor</td></tr>  
  <tr><td>Amy Frank</td><td >Computer Engineer</td></tr>  
</table>

<p>Specifying the height for one cell will affect the whole row. Height is set in fixed pixels: (height=70px)</p>
<table>
  <tr><th style="height: 70px;">Names</th><th>Profession</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Michael Fernandez</td><td>Doctor</td></tr>  
  <tr><td>Amy Frank</td><td >Computer Engineer</td></tr>  
</table>

<p>Specifying 100% for table width will occupy the whole width of the parent element:</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr><th>Names</th><th>Profession</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Michael Fernandez</td><td>Doctor</td></tr>  
  <tr><td>Amy Frank</td><td >Computer Engineer</td></tr>  
</table>
<hr>


#### text-align

This property is used to align the text of <th> and <td> cells left, right or center (week 3 recap). 

Default:

+ `<th>` - center
+ `<td>` - left

```html
td { text-align: right;}
```

#### vertical-align

This property is used to align the text of <th> and <td> cells top, bottom or middle.

Default:

+ `<th>` - middle
+ `<td>` - middle

```html
th { vertical-align: top; }
```

#### padding

Right now our table looks quite cramped. We use the padding property on <th> and <td> to provide some space between border and content in cell. It takes its value in units of length like `px`, `cm`, `%` - relative to parent container's width, etc.

```html
th, td { padding: 15px; }
```

This will add 15px space around the content on all sides.

You can also apply different padding styles for four individual sides by using:

+ padding-top: `th, td { padding-top: 15px; }`
+ padding-right: `th, td { padding-right: 25px; }`
+ padding-bottom: `th, td { padding-bottom: 35px; }`
+ padding-left: `th, td { padding-left: 45px; }`

Alternatively, padding can also be provided as a shorthand property where you can specify all four sides in one go:

```html
th, td { padding: 20px 30px 40px 50px; }
```

It is specified in the order: top, right, bottom and left padding.

<hr>
<table style="border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse;">
  <tr><th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px;">Names</th><th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px;">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px;">Michael</td><td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 20px;">21</td></tr>
</table>
<hr>

#### border-spacing

`border-spacing` specifies the distance between two cell borders in pixels. This is different from padding which is space between content in cell and border. It takes its value in units of length like px, cm, % - relative to parent container's width, etc.

It has the inherit property whose default value is 0.

It takes two values for horizontal and vertical spacing. If only one value is provided, it is used for both horizontal and vertical spacing: 

```html
table { border-spacing: 25px 50px; }
table, td, th (border-spacing: 25px; }
```

Some things to keep in mind:

+ If you try to provide spacing for only <th> and <td>, make sure there is space from the table border or you will not see a difference. 
+ You have to set - `table { border-collapse: separate; }` for it to take effect.

<hr>
<table style="border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 50px;">
  <tr><th style="border-spacing: 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Names</th><th style="border-spacing: 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border-spacing: 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Michael</td><td style="border-spacing: 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">21</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 25px 50px;">
  <tr><th style="border-spacing: 25px 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Names</th><th style="border-spacing: 25px 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border-spacing: 25px 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">Michael</td><td style="border-spacing: 25px 50px; border: 1px solid black;"">21</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style="border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 50px 25px; border: 1px solid black;"">
  <tr><th style="border-spacing: 50px 25px; border: 1px solid black;"">Names</th><th style="border-spacing: 50px 25px; border: 1px solid black;"">Age</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="border-spacing: 50px 25px; border: 1px solid black;"">Michael</td><td style="border-spacing: 50px 25px; border: 1px solid black;"">21</td></tr>
</table>
<hr>


#### Side-borders

The first property border will set a border to all four sides. You can also set borders to individual sides - top, right, bottom, left:

```html
th, td { border-right: 1px solid black; }
```

<hr>
<table style=" border-collapse: collapse; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">
  <tr><th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Names</th><th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Age</th><th style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Michael</td><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">21</td><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Male</td></tr>      
  <tr><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Amy</td><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">37</td><td style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid black;">Female</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<table style=" border-collapse: collapse; padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
  <tr><th style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Names</th><th style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Age</th><th style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Gender</th></tr>
  <tr><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Michael</td><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">21</td><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Male</td></tr>        
  <tr><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Amy</td><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">37</td><td style="padding: 15px; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Female</td></tr> 
</table>

### Styling your table (continued)

#### zebra table

A zebra table has alternating colors for table rows making it easier to differentiate data between rows. You can specify which rows you want to differentiate using a different color. Typically, you apply this property to a set of even or odd table rows to created a striped effect. You can set odd or even rows a particular color and leave the other rows white (default color).

```css
tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: grey; }
tr:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #ccff99; }
```

The 'nth-child' selector matches every element that is the nth child of the table or any parent element. Therefore,

```css
tr:nth-child(3n) { background-color: grey; }
```

will make the every third list item grey. 

[Demo File](prjs/5.5-Zebra.html)


#### hover to highlight

Using the hover property on your `<tr>`, you can mouse over rows in your table to highlight them in the color you specify. This is useful to help users differentiate data between rows.

```css
tr:hover {background-color: #ccff99; }
```

Example: [Hover over these tables](prjs/5.5-Hover.html)


#### overflow

With padding, additional columns and rows, your table can easily grow rather big overflowing out of the `<div>` you had planned for your table in your Web page. You can use the CSS `overflow` property to resolve this. It has four values other than initial (sets the default value) and inherit (from parent element).

+ __visible__ - Content that has overflowed is visible outside the parent element. Eg: Text in a box overflows outside box and is visible.
+ __hidden__ - Content that has overflowed is hidden. This makes the overflowed content inaccessible.
+ __scroll__ - Content that has overflowed is hidden but a scroll bar is added to make it accessible.
+ __auto__ - Content that has overflowed is hidden but a scroll bar is automatically added to view hidden content.

To address left and right edges of content, you can use `overflow-x` and to address top and bottom edges of content, you can use `overflow-y`.

#### In summary: a fancy table

As a conclusion to this tables section, [here](prjs/5.5-Fancy.html) is a complete table design.

Note: This table contains multi-line headers. You can find more information on the right way to design tables of different header types on this W3C [Tables Concepts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/) page.

#### Knowledge check 5.2.3

Try the code above in an HTML editor and view the output. The border spacing property is supposed to create a space between two border cells. There should be a 50px space between table border and cell borders and between cell borders. In this example, that is not the case. Why?

a. table border is not set <br/>
b. border-collapse should be set to separate <br/>
c. border-spacing should not be specified in pixels <br/>
d. There is a syntax error in the code above

Ans: b <br/>
Explanation: For border spacing to take effect, border-collapse must be set to 'separate'. Setting border-collapse to 'collapse' will merge cell and table borders into one so as to avoid double borders. Revisit the Border Spacing section in the 'Styling your table' unit.

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, realtime remote pair programming.


## 5.3 Multimedia

### Audio element

`audio` and `video` are new HTML 5 elements that were highly anticipated. With HTML5 support for multimedia, this has become much easier, than previous methods.

#### Audio tag

You can use the `<audio>` tag to embed audio in your page.

```html
<audio src="sounds/flute.mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio file.
</audio>
```

Any text within the `<audio>` tags will be displayed if the browser does not support the audio element. You should add such a message to provide better user experience for your page as it will be viewed in all types of devices and browsers.

The `audio` element has several attributes that can be used to configure audio playback. The following table lists the audio element's attributes:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="10%">Attribute</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="50%">Description</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="40%">Usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Used to specify the URL of the audio file to embed.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Values:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">absolute URL (file residing somewhere on the Web)</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">relative URL (within your Web site)</span></li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>controls</td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Boolean attribute when specified provides controls for the user like play, pause, seek bar and volume</span></p>
      <p><img alt="Controls from HTML5 audio" src="https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/327f2b7346ed0f5b804d41e3d49dd8ea/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018+type@asset+block/audio-controls.PNG" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" width="263" height="26"></p>
    </td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3" controls&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>loop</td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Boolean attribute when specified loops media content</span></p>
    </td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3" controls loop&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>muted</td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Boolean attribute when specified mutes media when playback begins</span></p>
    </td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3" controls muted&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
<td>preload</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Allows author to communicate to the browser which settings will work best - audio should not be preloaded (none), only audio metadata is fetched (metadata), audio file can be downloaded when page loads (auto)</span><br><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">values: none, metadata, auto</span></p>
</td>
<td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3" controls preload="auto"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>autoplay</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Boolean attribute when specified will automatically begin playing the source file as soon as it can without waiting for the entire audio file to finish downloading</span></p>
<p></p>
</td>
<td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;audio src="sounds/flute.mp3" controls autoplay&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</span><audio autoplay="autoplay"></audio></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here is an example code:

```html
<audio src="https://archive.org/download/Music_Calgary_PD_1/The.good.the.bad.and.the.ashy.mp3" 
    controls loop muted preload="none">
  Your browser does not support the audio file.
</audio>
```

Output for the code above (try playing):

<p><audio src="https://archive.org/download/Music_Calgary_PD_1/The.good.the.bad.and.the.ashy.mp3" preload="none" loop="loop" controls="controls" muted="">
  Your browser does not support the audio file.
</audio></p>

If you hit play and didn't hear anything, remember that we have added the muted attribute. So the audio will be muted when playback begins. Increase the volume to hear the music.

#### Audio file formats

Just like image file formats, not all audio file formats are supported by all browsers. You will want to use common audio file formats for browser compatibility ensuring the highest probability that your audio file will play. 

The most common ones are MP3, WAV and Ogg. 

[This page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats) under 'Browser Compatibility' lists the audio formats supported by the `audio` element and their browser support.

Here is some information regarding different types of audio formats and their compression techniques that can help you decide which audio format to choose apart from `audio` element and browser compatibility:

+ There are three major groups of audio file formats - uncompressed (eg: WAV), lossless compressed (eg: MPEG-4, WMA Lossless) and lossy compressed (eg: Opus, MPC, AAC, WMA Lossy). 
+ In uncompressed audio file formats, no compression is applied to the audio file. The memory used for both sound and silence is the same though silence contains less information/data.
+ In lossless compression, no data is lost but the file is compressed as silence is designed to take up very little space. Compared to uncompressed, lossless compression's compression ratio is approximately 2:1.
+ Lossy compression provides the greatest compression by simplifying the data and removing some audio information resulting in some loss of quality. It is also the most popular. There are techniques in place to ensure that the parts of sound that is lost has little effect on quality. You can also select a range of compression rates. The larger the rate of compression, the bigger the loss in quality and smaller the file size. 
+ The audio format Ogg Opus has two parts to it. 'Ogg' is a digital container format. It is a specification that describes how different elements of data and metadata work in an audio file. However, it provides no information on how the data is compressed. So a program that opens a container file like 'Ogg' might not know how to decode it. 'Opus', the second part of the audio format, represents the encoding or decoding mechanism for that stream of audio. Opus is a lossy audio coding format.
+ If you have an audio file in one format and wish to convert it to another, there are a lot of software applications available to help you do that. 


#### Source element for multiple source files

The `source` element, also new in HTML5, serves the same purpose as the `src` attribute in an `audio` element. It is used to specify source files for the `audio` and `video` elements. Using the `source` element, you can specify multiple source files. The `<source>` tag is self-closing, therefore, it does not require a closing tag.

Example:

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+3T2016+type@asset+block@splash.wav" 
    type="audio/wav">
  <source src="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+3T2016+type@asset+block@splash.mp3" 
    type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

Output for code above (try playing):

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2016+type@asset+block@splash.wav" type="audio/wav">
  <source src="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2016+type@asset+block@splash.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio></p>

The advantage of providing multiple source files in different formats is that if the browser doesn't support the first format, it will try the second source file. The browser can select from the list based on its file format or codec support. In the code snippet example above, Internet Explorer does not support .wav files. So if you tried to play the file above in Internet Explorer, the browser would have tried to play .wav, failed and played the .mp3 version instead. 

The following table lists the `<source>` element's attributes:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: left; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="10%">Attribute</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="50%">Description</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="40%">Usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Specifies the URL of the media file</span></td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;source src="sounds/flute.mp3"&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Specifies the internet media type, also known as the MIME type for the audio resource. A media type is an identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted over the internet like text and audio files.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It consists of a type and a sub-type. Eg: "audio/mpeg" - <strong>audio</strong> is the type and <strong>mpeg</strong> is the subtype. It can also take optional parameters that can be specified after a semicolon - "audio/ogg; codecs=opus" means the audio is in the ogg format and uses the opus codec. If the browser supports the Ogg format but not the Opus codec, the audio file will not load.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If the type attribute is not specified, the media type is retrieved from the server.</span></p>
    </td>
    <td><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&lt;source src="sounds/flute.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Knowledge check 5.3.1

How do you handle browsers that do not support the audio element?

a. Don't do anything <br/>
b. Add text in your audio element with a message stating that your browser does not support the audio element or audio format <br/>
c. Do not include the 'autoplay' attribute so as to avoid an error being displayed <br/>
d. Add multiple source elements

Ans: b <br/>
Explanation: You can add text within your audio tags that will be displayed if a browser does not support the audio element. This is highly recommended as your page will be viewed by a variety of browsers. Learn more about audio element support in browsers here: http://caniuse.com/#search=%3Caudio%3E

<br/>


### Video element

Video is fairly new in HTML5. Previously, the most reliable way to add video was the Adobe Flash Player for example.

You can use the video element to embed video in your page. You can specify the location of your video file using the src attribute or source element (for multiple source files).

```html
<video src="multimedia/running.mp4">
  Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element.
</video>
```

Any text within the `<video>` tags will be displayed if the browser does not support the video element. You should add such a message to provide better user experience for your page as it will be viewed in all types of devices and browsers. 

Similar to the audio element, the video element has several attributes that can be used to configure playback. The following table lists the video element's attributes:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; max-width: 100%;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="10%">Attribute</td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Output for code above (try playing):

<video src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4" preload="none" loop="loop" controls="controls" muted="" poster="https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2016+type@asset+block@badgehtml5.png" width="240" height="150">
  Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element.
</video>


#### Poster attribute

The `<video>` tag has an important attribute that you don't find on the audio element.  The poster attribute is used to specify what picture is shown before the video starts playing.  By default, the poster shown is simply the first frame of the video, but the poster attribute can be used to specify a different image.  It can specify a particular frame of the video or, like a real movie poster, it can be an image that doesn't actually appear in the video.

#### Video file formats

Just like audio file formats, not all video file formats are supported by all browsers. You should use common video file formats for browser compatibility ensuring the highest probability that your video file will play.

The most common ones are MP4, WebM and Ogg.

This page under 'Browser Compatibility' lists the video formats supported by the video element and their browser support for both desktop and mobile. Using the source element, you will have to provide a combination of video formats to target most browsers.

Here is some information regarding different types of video formats and their compression techniques that can help you decide which video format to choose apart from video element and browser compatibility:

+ Most videos go through some form of compression to reduce redundancy in video files and make them smaller, allowing them to download faster. Most also use audio compression techniques to compress sound in video files. 
+ Like audio, there are three major groups of video file formats - uncompressed, lossless compressed ([list of lossless video compression formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs#Lossless_video_compression)) and lossy compressed ([list of lossy video compression formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs#Lossy_compression_2)). 
+ In uncompressed video file formats, no compression is applied to the video file. 
+ In lossless compression, no data is lost. If you were to uncompress a file compressed using the lossless technique, you will get back the exact same data you started with.
+ Most videos use lossy compression as it results in significantly smaller video files. Lossy compression provides compression by simplifying the data and removing video information resulting in some loss of quality. There are techniques in place to ensure that the parts of the video that are lost have little effect on quality. You can also select a range of compression rates. The larger the rate of compression, the bigger the loss in quality and smaller the file size. However, if you uncompress a video file that was compressed using the lossy technique, you will not be able to retrieve the same data you put in. With text or spreadsheets, loss of data might be a significant problem. However, with images and video losing a bit of quality is not going to affect the file because you can still make out what the video is about. 
+ The video format 'H.264 and MP3 in MP4' has three parts to it. H.264 is a video compression standard. MP3 is an audio coding format that uses lossy compression for sound in the video. MP4, like Ogg, is a digital container format. It stores audio and video data rather than code the information. A program that opens a container file like MP4 might not know how to decode it. So it requires other standards like H.264 and MP3 to dictate how the video will be coded and possibly compressed.
+ If you have a video file in one format and wish to convert it to another, there are a lot of software applications available to help you do that.


#### Knowledge check 5.3.2

Which of the following attributes is used to provide a placeholder frame before user starts or seeks the video?

a. muted <br/>
b. controls <br/>
c. poster <br/>
d. frame

Ans: c <br/>
Explanation: A placeholder frame can be any image you can add to display before the user plays or seeks the video. This can be added using the 'poster' attribute. Refer to the first code snippet on this video unit to see its usage.

<br/>


### Video - Source/Track elements

#### Source element for multiple source files

The source element that we saw in the previous unit is also used to specify multiple source files for the video element. The `<source>` tag is self-closing and so does not require a closing tag.

```html
<video controls height="320" width="240">
  <source src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element.
</video>
```

The advantage of providing multiple source files in different formats is that if the browser doesn't support the first format, it will try the second source file. The browser can select from the list based on its file format or codec support. There is no one format that is supported by all browsers. So you will have to use the source element to list a combination of formats.

The following table lists the source element's attributes:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; max-width: 100%;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff; min-width: 5em;">Attribute</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;">Description</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff; min-width: 13em;">Usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td>Specifies the URL or location of the media file</td>
    <td>&lt;source src="multimedia/small.mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>type</td>
    <td>
      <p>Specifies the internet media type, also known as the MIME type for the audio/video resource. A media type is an identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted over the internet like text and audio files.</p>
      <p>It consists of a type and a sub-type. Eg: "video/mp4" - <b>video</b>&nbsp;is the type and <strong>mp4</strong>&nbsp;is the subtype. It can also take optional parameters that can be specified after a semicolon - "video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"" means the video&nbsp;is in the mp4 format and uses the codecs -&nbsp;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2. If the browser supports the mp4&nbsp;format but none of the&nbsp;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&nbsp;codecs, the video file will not load.</p>
      <p>If the type attribute is not specified, the media type is retrieved from the server.</p>
    </td>
    <td>&lt;source src="multimedia/small.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Track element for captions and subtitles

The `<video>` element is very similar to the HTML5 `<audio>` element except for one addition - the `<track>` element. The `<track>` element is used to add timed text like subtitles, captions or any text you would like to display to the user when the video is playing.

+ Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT) files are the standard to include subtitles or captions. You can learn how to create them here.
+ Captions and subtitles are not the same. Subtitles are meant to translate the language (for those who do not understand the language being spoken in the video). Captions are meant for the deaf or people who have difficulty hearing. It includes sound effects and other significant audio like music and lyrics and is usually in the same language as the audio. Read more about their difference here.
+ Like the `<source>` tag, you can add multiple `<track>` tags in your video element to add multiple subtitle/caption tracks. This is commonly done when providing them in different languages.
+ The `<track>` tag is self-closing and so does not require a closing tag. You specify the `<track>` element as a child element of your `<video>` tag like this:

````html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="module.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="module-captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" default>
  Your browser does not support the HTML5 video element.
</video>
````

The following table lists the `<track>` element's attributes:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="10%">Attribute</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="50%">Description</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="40%">Usage</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>default</td>
    <td>It is a boolean attribute. If you have multiple tracks for the same video file, you can specify which one is the default using this attribute. It can be used on one track element in a video. If you only have one track element, default should still be added to deliver the video with captions turned on in most browsers.</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;video src="multimedia/small.mp4" controls&gt; <br/>
      &nbsp; &lt;track src="captions/small-en.vtt" label="english" default&gt;<br/>
      &nbsp; &lt;track src="captions/small-fr.vtt" label="French"&gt;<br/>
      &lt;/video&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>kind</td>
      <td>Specifies the kind of the source&nbsp;file. <br>Values: subtitles (default value), captions, descriptions (textual description of the video best suited for the blind who cannot be seen), chapters (meant for chapter titles), metadata (kind of track that is used by scripts and is not visible to the user).</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;track src="captions/small-en.vtt" kind="captions"&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>label</td>
    <td>Label of the track.&nbsp;Browser uses the label value to display track options for user to select.&nbsp;</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;track src="captions/small-en.vtt" label="English"&gt;<br/>
      <span style="line-height: 22.4px;">&lt;track src="captions/small-fr.vtt" label="French"&gt;</span></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td>URL of track. The <strong>file must be on a Web server</strong>. The .vtt file cannot be loaded from a file (file://) protocol.</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;track src="http://www.xyz.org/small-en.vtt"&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>srclang</td>
    <td>Language of text track. Eg: en, fr. <br>If kind&nbsp;is 'subtitles', then the srclang attribute must be specified.</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;track src="captions/small-en.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en"&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>

### Activities - Multimedia and discussion

1. Embed an audio file in an HTML page with the following requirements:
    + Player has controls to play, pause, seek, etc.
    + Audio must automatically start playing when page loads
    + Audio must be muted when playback begins
2. Create an HTML audio player that plays an audio file of your choice in Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Use multiple sources if you have to.
3. Create an HTML video player that plays a video file of your choice in Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Use multiple sources if you have to.
4. Create a WebVTT file for [this video](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/5315ef6081b631a89442c13f916325c2/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018+type@asset+block/cat__online-video-cutter.com_.mp4). Then embed this video in an HTML page with the captions you created.

Note 1: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

  + JS Bin: http://jsbin.com ([JS Bin tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-tools-of-the-trade-jsbin--net-36843))
  + CodePen: http://codepen.io ([CodePen tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/))

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, realtime remote pair programming.

Note 2: If you miss the "pizza cats" video already, don't worry! This video is extensively used in the next HTML5 courses: [HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices](https://www.edx.org/course/html5-coding-essentials-w3cx-html5-1x-2) and [HTML5 Apps and Games](https://www.edx.org/course/html5-apps-games-advanced-techniques-w3cx-html5-2x) ;)


## 5.4 Embedding content

### The iframes tag

There are tags for all kinds of content in your Web page, text, images, videos, animations.  There's even a tag that allows you to put another Web page in your Web page - the `<iframe>` tag (HTML Inline Frame Element).  Why would you want to do this?  Well, it enables a lot of possibilities.

The popular online code editor [CodePen](https://codepen.io/#) has several iframes in it to display html, css, javascript and output together. Iframes are generally used in Web pages to show external content/resources. The type of content is not limited to other Web pages. You can add YouTube videos or display a PDF file (some browsers will display the file inline while some older browsers will try to download it instead).

An `<iframe>` tag can be as simple as this:

```html
<p>This is a parent page that will host the iframe.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.w3.org/">
  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>
```

<p>This is a parent page that will host the iframe.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.w3.org/">
</iframe>

Because iframes are HTML elements, they can be styled just like other elements, with borders, margins, sizes specified with CSS rules:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4" style="border: 10px solid red; padding: .5rem; margin: 1rem; box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px #888888; width: 355; height: 200;"></iframe>

Here, we've embedded a YouTube video with an iframe like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YE7VzlLtp-4" style="border: 10px solid red;padding: .5rem;
  margin: 1rem;box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px #888888;width: 355;height: 200;"></iframe>
```

And we've added styling like this to get the border and drop-shadow:

```css
iframe {
  border: 10px solid red;
  padding: .5rem;
  margin: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 20px 20px 10px #888888;
  width: 355;
  height: 200;
}
```

There is one significant problem with iframes. Suppose you create your Web page, containing only an iframe with `src="http://foo.com"`, with no borders, padding or margin. By all appearances, you would seem to be on the Web site foo.com. If you don't look at the URL, it might be difficult to tell. For reasons like this, some Web sites disallow their inclusion, so if you create an iframe with `src="https://google.com"`, you'll get a blank frame and an error message in the console.  This isn't a bug, it's a feature.

There are a number of important attributes for an `<iframe>` tag, but for now we'll just look at a few of them:

<table style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" table-layout="auto" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" align="center">
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="10%">Attribute</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="40%">Description</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="25%">Value</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; background-color: #3d64ff; color: #ffffff;" width="25%">Example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td>Specifies the address of the page you want to display in your frame. This is the primary attribute of interest in the iframe.</td>
    <td>URL</td>
    <td>&lt;iframe src="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>allowfullscreen</td>
    <td>This will allow the iframe to open "Full screen mode", often used with videos. Without this attribute, full screen mode is disabled for the iframe.</td>
    <td>no value</td>
    <td><span style="line-height: 22.4px;">&lt;iframe src="https://www.w3.org/" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>Specifies a name for the iframe. Using the name attribute, the iframe can act as a target for a link. Just as the 'self' target will replace the current window with the site at the href URL, and "_blank" will open a new window at that URL, if you set the name attribute, that name can be used as a target so that when you click on it, the new page will open up in that iframe.</td>
    <td>text</td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;iframe name="frame-one" src="https://www.w3.org/"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
      <p>&lt;a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="frame-one"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sandbox</td>
    <td>
      <p>This can&nbsp;apply a number of restrictions on the iframe, preventing the site in the iframe from using pop-ups, running scripts, automatically running videos and numerous other things. &nbsp;This helps avoid some of the potential security issues that iframes may be prone to.</p>
    </td>
    <td><no value="">no value (applies all restrictions)<br>allow-forms<br>allow-modals<br>allow-orientation-lock<br>allow-pointer-lock<br>allow-popups<br>allow-same-origin<br>allow-scripts<br>allow-top-navigation<br></no></td>
    <td>
      <p>&lt;iframe src="https://www.w3.org/" sandbox&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
      <p>OR</p>
      <p>&lt;iframe src="https://www.w3.org/" sandox="allow-popups"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>width, height</td>
    <td>While width and height are valid attributes for an iframe, they should be avoided in favor of CSS properties.</td>
    <td>pixels</td>
    <td>&lt;iframe src="https://www.w3.org/" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

__Notes:__

1. Certain Web sites like Google and Yahoo disallow embedding their Web pages in iframes. So you will not be able to use these pages in an iframe.
2. Not all attributes are supported in all browsers. You are encouraged to explore their browser support before adding to your HTML.
3. You can find more details about iframes from the [W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-iframe-element).

------------------------------------------

Iframes can be very useful:

+ Iframes load separately from the main page. However, they do block the main page's load command until its content finishes loading. You can avoid this by applying some Javascript. This allows them to load independently. Then, if the embedded page you are displaying loads slower, you can use your parent page to keep the reader occupied.
+ Sandboxing provides security.
+ Great for third party content like ads.
+ It is convenient to use if you need to have one part of your page static while the other is changed - i.e. navigation menus. Helps reduce bandwidth and server load because we can avoid loading the same content every time a new page is visited in your webpage.

However, there can be some disadvantages:

+ It is easy to misuse them. It should be considered a piece of content in the webpage and not as an integral part of it.
+ Accessibility of iframes is poor. Screenreaders do not process them well but you can proceed to use iframes with a notice for the reader.
+ You have no control over the content in an iframe if you display external content. That content can change anytime or can upload malicious content without your permission.
+ Search engines have trouble accessing and in turn indexing the content in your iframes. This doesn't help your search ranking.

### The ismap and usemap attributes

Important: The attributes we will see in this unit - `ismap` and `usemap` are __image attributes__. Since they use the`<link>` tag, having learned hyperlinks, now would be a good time to explore them. Be sure to watch the video at the end of this unit.

Adding the ismap or usemap attributes to the `<img>` tag means that the picture is an image with clickable areas. Imagine a picture of a world map where different countries on the map can be clicked and it navigates to another page like the country's wikipedia page. Simply put, we say such an image is mapped. Here is an example of an image-map.

#### The 'ismap' attribute

```html
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="ismap tutorial" ismap>
```

`ismap` is a __boolean attribute__ i.e. its value is either true or false. Thus, just the presence of the attribute indicates that it is a mapped image. To be more precise, we say it is a server-side image-map.

An `<img>` tag with the `src` and `ismap` attributes creates an image with the image source file and indicates it is a server-side image-map. How will your code know that if you click on a part of your image, i.e. 'Australia in a world map', it should navigate to the country's Wikipedia page? We need to create a map file with these details and then add the location of this map file using the anchor element. Here is a code sample:

```html
<a href="/ismap-image/ismap.cgi" target="_self">
   <img src="images/logo.png" alt="ismap tutorial" ismap>
</a>
```

Here, the `href` attribute points to the location of the map file. The target attribute indicates where the page it navigates to should open. '_self' will open in the same page whereas '_blank' will open it in a new tab or window.

ismap only works if the `<img>` tag is used within the anchor element like in the code above. This is important because without a link to the target map file, it has no idea what to do with your ismap specification.

Let's look at how the code above works.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/2ccb5b1d17534407918e7f2d963617d9/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40fd6fc633e26d417290e6e78df5bb300d">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" alt="Image illustrating how an image map works, how it processes mouse click coordinates using a map file that define target areas" title="Image Map workflow" width="250" src="https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/e9ac0c6a8e11be57f47e7b43dca6ffa3/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018+type@asset+block/2.4-ismap3.jpg" >
</a>

Let's go back to our world map example where clicking on different parts of the image will take you to a page about the country you clicked on. The map file '/ismap-image/ismap.cgi' defines target areas. We can define the image in terms of coordinates. When a user clicks on a part of the image, we can calculate the exact 'x' and 'y' coordinates of the image that was clicked. When the user clicks, the browser will consult with the map file on the server (specified in the anchor tag), by sending these mouse click coordinates to the server. Based on these coordinates, the map file will return the Web page it should navigate to, to the browser.

Read more about image maps [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map). You might be inclined to assume an image map will only be used for an actual map. However, there are a lot more use cases for it. The [Atlas Magazine](http://www.atlasmagazine.com/win98r.html) is a good example.

Try this: Navigate to the [Atlas magazine](http://www.atlasmagazine.com/win98r.html) and explore the header image with a 'laughing budha' like image. The image acts as a site navigator. Clicking on different parts of the image will bring you to different parts of the Web page. You can use image maps in many creative ways.

#### The 'usemap' attribute

`usemap` is a lot like `ismap` and is more widely used. `ismap` deals with server-side image-maps whereas `usemap` deals with client-side image-maps.

+ Server-side image-maps: use separate map files that have to be downloaded. They depend on the server for translating the request. They also create additional network traffic. 
+ Client-side image-maps: reside within an HTML document. The browser takes care of the translation (translating mouse coordinates clicked to corresponding Web pages). 

Client-side maps are becoming increasingly popular. `usemap` is NOT of type boolean. It takes in the name of the map with a '#' character preceding it.

```html
<img src="navigator.jpg" alt="Pages in this Web site" usemap="#navigatormap">
```

Like ismap, usemap cannot be used by itself. In ismap, we used the anchor tag to specify the map file. In usemap, we use the `<area>` element as a child of `<map>` element to specify the coordinates and the page it should navigate to. The usemap value should match the map element's name or id attribute. 

```html
<img src="images/crossroads.jpg" alt="Crossroads" usemap="#navigatormap">
<map name="navigatormap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,195,439" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millery" alt="Millery">
  <area shape="rect" coords="196,0,390,439" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeny" alt="Nomeny">
</map>
```

`<map>` - defines a client-side image map and is used to create a relationship between the image and the map by matching the map name and usemap's value. It contains a set of area elements.

`<area>` - defines the areas that can be clicked and the pages it should navigate to. Typically takes the shape of the area, coordinates of the area, URL of the page it should redirect to and the `alt` attribute (short description). 

The `shape` attribute in the `<area>` tag has four values:

+ circle - The clickable area is a circle. You need to specify three coordinates. E.g. coords="89,52,6". The first two is the coordinate center of the circle and the last is the radius.
+ rect - The clickable area is a rectangle. You need to specify four coordinates. E.g. coords="0,0,195,439". This is the x & y coordinates of the top left corner and the x & y coordinates of the bottom right corner. 
+ poly - The clickable area is a polygon of any number of sides. This shape is very flexible and takes as many pairs of coordinates as you need to form your polygon.  E.g. coords="277,85,322,87,275,173,269,138". The last set of coordinates can match the first set. If it doesn't, the browser will automatically match it for you to close the polygon. 
+ default - The clickable area is the whole image. 
Read more about the area tag here.

Here is a working example of usemap.

```html
<img src="images/crossroads.jpg" alt="Crossroads" usemap="#navigatormap">
<map name="navigatormap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,195,439" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millery" alt="Millery">
  <area shape="rect" coords="196,0,390,439" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeny" alt="Nomeny">
</map>
```

  <area shape="rect" coords="196,0,390,439" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeny" alt="Nomeny">
</map>


Note: If the `<img>` is inside an `<a>` or `<button>` element, clicking on it will be interpreted as clicking on the link or button and usemap will not work.

#### 'ismap' & 'usemap' Attributes Activity

To get a better understanding on the usemap attribute, edit this project on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/w3devcampus/pen/BROBwG/) shown [here](prjs/5.4-Map.html).


It showcases two image maps that can be used for page navigation with the areas mapped using 'rect' and 'poly' shapes. The coordinates were generated using an online image map generator tool.

Experiment with it and try your own image map variations. 

#### Knowledge check 2.5.4

The map element's name or id attribute should match the ______ attribute's value.

a. ismap <br/>
b. coord <br/>
c. usemap <br/>
d. href

Ans: c <br/>
Explanation: Usemap cannot be used by itself and should be associated with the map element. Matching the map element's name/id with the usemap attribute's value creates a relationship between the map and the image.

## 5.5 CSS tricks

### Decorative images and backgrounds

As we saw earlier, the `<img>` tag is meant to be used for semantically important imagery.  For example, the pictures that accompany a news story are important to understanding the news story and therefore should be displayed with the `<img>` tag.  The example of the cool banner with teletypes and coffee was meant to evoke competence and urgency, however, that image is __not__ essential to understanding the news story. That image is decorative.

Decorative images are incorporated via CSS.

There are quite a few CSS properties for controlling borders, background images and colors. Let's look at the most common. Take notice that as you leverage borders and backgrounds that you will begin to see the underside of the Web. How big is the area around a link? You might have never thought about it before, now it'll be visible. Can we make it larger or smaller? Are these items butted against each other? Can we space them out, or bring them closer? We will touch on these things as well.

Let's look at the most common CSS properties: `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-size`, and `background-position`.

#### background-color

The `background-color` CSS property will fill the rectangle of the given element with a solid background color. In addition to the values of `transparent` and `none`, there are all the values of that we saw applicable to the `color` property.

In the example below we apply a variety of background colors to a hyperlink (`<a>`), paragraph (`<p>`), unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`):

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-01.png" alt="The `background-color` CSS property will fill the rectangle of the given element with a solid background color." title="Background Color" width="600" >
</a>

HTML:

```html
<p class="p-blue">This is the list of critters <a href="#req">requested</a> by the owners</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wasp</li>
  <li>Ant</li>
  <li>Moth</li>
  <li>Ostritch</li>
</ul>
```

CSS:

```css
  p { background-color: #3E3F67; }
p a { background-color: #6E7099; }
 ul { background-color: #FFC592; }
 li { background-color: #CC602D; }
```


#### background-image

The `background-image` property is used to set an external image file as the background to a particular HTML element.  To bind in an external file, the value is `url`, followed by an open parenthesis `(`, followed by a quote `"`, then the path, a closing quote `"` and a closing parentheses `)`.  The path can be a URL, or a path relative from the file the CSS is in.

```css
div { background-image: url("https://www.w3.org/2008/site/images/logo-w3c-mobile-lg"); } 
div { background-image: url("images/kitten.png"); }
```

As these are decorative images, there are quite a few different usage scenarios that can leverage background images. For instance, an image can be used as repeating tile, or a background image can fit its parent element, or be a large panoramic image not fully viewed.  These scenarios can be constructed with other CSS properties, like `background-repeat`, `background-size`, and `background-attach` (as well as several others).

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-02.png" alt="text" title="Background image" width="500" >
</a>

HTML:

```html
<p class="kitten">Women and cats will do as they please, and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea. <br />- Robert A. Heinlein</p>
```

CSS:

```css
.kitten { 
   background-image: url("kittens.jpg");
}
```

#### background-repeat

By default, if the rectangular area of an element is bigger than the image itself, then the image will repeat and fill the space, like tiles.  For example:

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-03.png" alt="Repeated backhround images" title="Backgroumd Image w/ repeatition" width="400">
</a>


The `background-repeat` property can be used to control this.  It's more commonly used values are: `repeat`, `repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, and __`no-repeat`__. The `no-repeat` value is very useful, and bears repeating.

There are advanced uses of this property.  Notice in the above example, that if the size of the parent element is not exactly a multiple of the tile, then the image may be "cropped" and bleed off the side.  That can be managed by centering the tile (with `background-position: center;`).  Additionally the `background-repeat` property can also be used to control how it repeats. The `space` value will result in cropped images; it means "repeat, and add space between the elements so there is no cropping".  Note that this property does not let you directly manipulate the amount of spacing. That is calculated for you.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-04.png" alt="Background images w/ repitation and space" title="Repeated background images separated w/ space" width="400" >
</a>

#### background-size

When _not repeating_, it is very useful to size a background image to fit its element.  The `background-size` can be used for this.  There are two very useful values:  `contain` and `cover`.   The contain value will put the entire image into the space of the element, however, the space of the element may not be completely filled if the aspect ratio of the element and the image do not match.  The `cover` value is the opposite. It will completely fill the element but the image may be cropped off two opposite sides.  Neither contain or cover will distort or squish the image.  Its aspect ratio is maintained.

Here we demonstrate the difference. A border has been applied to the paragraph to clearly show the bounds of the parent `<p>` element.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-05.png" alt="Sizing background image" title="Adjust background image size" width="400" >
</a>

The `background-size` property can also be used to more exactly size the image.  When used in this fashion, it takes two values separated by a space. The first governs the width, the second the height.  Examples:

```css
.kittens  { background-size: 100px 120px; } /* might distort */
.puppies  { background-size: 100px auto; }  /* auto preserves aspect ratio, no distorting */
.munchies { background-size: 50% auto; }    /* % is of percentage of parent (not of image). */
```

The px and % units were covered in the units section. Note that other units (rem, vh, etc.) have no guarantee of support.  

When specifying exact sizes, the `auto` value is extremely useful. It allows you to worry only about one dimension, and then the other will handle it for you. Otherwise there is a risk of stretching/distorting images. 

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-06.png" alt="text" title="caption" width="600" >
</a>

#### background-position

Like background-size, `background-position` can be used to place or offset a background image in the element. It takes two values (x and y) separated by a _space_ when used to exactly specify a position.

The most useful is the _center_ value.  It is position the center of the image in the center of the element. This is useful even with repeating tiles.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/5854bfc005394517ae62fc55fd58242e/bcb896dff4594fec9939c512437c6219/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B2T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%409b89ec0f679a4e5d9bb0befbe35e9c0a">

### Decorative borders and shadows

In the previous sub-section, we looked at decorative backgrounds and images. We will continue this theme by examining decorative borders and shadows.  Like background colors, once we start using borders we will be directly facing the underpinnings of HTML. Where does a span inside a paragraph begin and end? How far does it extend? We'll see how the various techniques for managing decorative CSS in the following sub-section.

For now, let's look at these new properties: `border-style`, `border-color`, `border-width`, border abbreviations, `border-radius` and `text-shadow`.

#### border-style

```css
p { border-style: solid; }
```

This property sets the style of a border.  Possible values include `none`, `hidden`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`, `double`, `groove`, `ridge`, `inset`, and `outset`. Here the visible border styles displayed on a gray border:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px solid #c8c8c8">solid</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px dotted #c8c8c8">dotted</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px dashed #c8c8c8">dashed</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px double #c8c8c8">double</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px groove #c8c8c8">groove</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px ridge #c8c8c8">ridge</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px inset #c8c8c8">inset</td>
    <td style="pading: 10px; border: 2px outset #c8c8c8">outset</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that the `groove`, `ridge`, `inset` and `outset` borders all use black in addition to any explicit border-color.  So if the `border-color` is also black they won't be effective.  Also `double`, `groove` and `ridge` are usually not satisfactory on thin borders.  They'll require a fat `border-width`.

 The difference between `none` and `hidden` has to do with the sizing and positioning of the element. An item with a `hidden` border is positioned as if it had a border, but the border is not drawn. Whereas with `border-style` of `none`, no space is allocated for the border at all.

#### border-color

Sets the color of the border.  

#### border-width

Sets the width of the border.  Supports a variety of units (px, em, rem ).  

#### border abbreviations

All border styles just introduced are actually abbreviations that can be broken out if needed. For example, here we set four different styles for a border:  

```css
p { 
   border-left-style: solid; 
   border-right-style: dotted; 
   border-bottom-style: dashed; 
   border-left-style: hidden; 
 }
 ```

This same thing can be done with `border-width` and `border-color` ( `border-left-color`, `border-top-width`, etc).

Or, going in the other direction, the CSS property border can help abbreviate even further.  Use the formula  `border: <width> <style> <color>;`  separating the values with spaces:

```css
p { border: 1px solid gray; }
```

#### border-radius

Sometimes it seems that the whole of the World Wide Web consists of round cornered rectangles.  Join the fun by using the `border-radius` property:

</tbody>
</table>

Note this is fun to use with a background color or background image and no border at all:

    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### box-shadow

A shadow effect can be applied to the outlining rectangle of an element with the `box-shadow` CSS property.  The `box-shadow` property is typically controlled with four values separated by spaces:

```css
box-shadow: <x-offset> <y-offset> <blur> <color>;
```

The offset values are dimension units (`px`, `em`, etc) can be positive or negative. Positive x values place the shadow to the right, and negative values place the shadow to the left. Similarly positive y values place the shadow vertically lower than the element and negative values move it up.

The `blur` value is also a dimension unit, but can only be 0 or positive.

<table>

  <tr><th>CSS</th><th>Result</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><span style="color: #0000ff;">  <br/>.illuminati</span> { <span style="color: #333399;">box-shadow</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">1px 1px 2px</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">black</span>; }<br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">.urakai</span> { <span style="color: #333399;">box-shadow</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">0px 0px 6px</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">black</span>; }<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">p</span> {<br/> <span style="color: #333399;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align</span>: <span style="color: #ff6600;">center</span>; <br/> <span style="color: #333399;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;padding</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">10px</span>; <span style="color: #808080;">/* make the box a little bigger */</span><br/>} </pre>

    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### text-shadow

This CSS property takes the same values as `box-shadow`, however, the shadow is applied directly to the text shapes:

```css
text-shadow:  <x-offset> <y-offset> <blur> <color>;
```

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr><th>CSS</th><th>Result</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><span style="color: #0000ff;">  .majestic-12</span> { <span style="color: #333399;">text-shadow</span>: <span style="color: #008080;">1px 1px 3px</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">black</span>; } </pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p style="text-align: center; padding: 10px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px black;">Majestic-12</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Managing element size

As you start to leverage borders, background colors, and the other decorative CSS properties we have seen in the previous sections you will need to become more aware of the element size and how to manage it.

#### The wrong way

A common trap that newbies fall into is to discover the `width`, `height`, `left` and `top` CSS properties and to start blindly using them.

These are useful properties, however, they should __not__ be your first choice.  These CSS properties depend upon other properties before they can even be used, and they can have unintended consequences. We'll explore them more in next module when covering Layout.  

Here is a simple example of a common error:

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr><th>CSS</th><th>Result</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><span style="color: #0000ff;">div</span> { <br/>    <span style="color: #333399;">width</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">40px</span>; <br/>    <span style="color: #333399;">border</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">2px</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">solid red</span>; <br/>    <span style="color: #333399;">font-size</span>: <span style="color: #008000;">18px</span>;<br/>} </pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="goof">
        <p>CSS is Awesome</p>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### Padding - The right way

The best way to control an element's size for the purpose of controlling how a border or background extends relative to the item itself is with the `padding` properties.

Padding is a way of making an element a little bigger than it would normally be.  Similar to margin, there are four padding properties.  The values are dimension units that can be 0 or a positive value; negative values are not allowed.

```css
padding-top:    0;
padding-right:  1em;
padding-bottom: 10px;
padding-left:   12px;
```

Similar to margin, this can be abbreviated with the padding property.

```css
padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>;
padding: <top and bottom> <right and left>;
padding: <all>;
```

When decorative CSS is not used by many CSS newbies, use padding like margin, to space things out. Note: That is not correct. Margins make space between elements and padding makes an element larger.

In this example, note that the use of padding does not make the text deviate from the baseline.  In addition, note that in the first paragraph we apply the same padding to all four sides. However, in the second paragraph we use different padding for different sides, thus placing the rectangle of the element relative to the text itself.

I'm confused - are you saying that I shouldn't use the width property to change the width?

Essentially yes. Let's qualify that a bit so there is no confusion.

This section has been about the decorative CSS properties, like borders, background colors, background images, and shadows. In the context of these things users often want to make an element "bigger", or keep the border a bit away. And in this context the `padding` property is absolutely the correct property that should be used to increase the elements size.  Do not use the `width` or `height` properties for this.

Furthermore, there are other issues associated with the `width` and `height` properties. We will discuss these in-depth in the next module. Here is a quick rundown:

+ `height` and `width` properties do not work on inline elements.
+ Many elements have natural behaviors that occur when height and width are __not__ set. These are generally advantageous. However, by setting the width and height you __lose__ those advantages. We'll understand this in next module.
+ Most Web pages are viewed in a variety of browser sizes, especially on mobile devices like phones or tablets. Overuse of explicit width and height can make your page unviewable on smaller devices.
+ The flexbox layout system (which we will see next) is incredibly powerful, but by over-determining explicit heights and widths you reduce its usefulness to you and your viewer.


### Knowledge checks

The following questions are ungraded. They are here to self-check your understanding of the concepts.

Style rule for questions 1 and 2:

```css
p {
  border: 2px solid black;
  background-color: rgb(150, 50, 20);
}
```

1. Color flush

    Examine the style rule above. Will the color always run flush to the border or will there sometimes be a gap?

    a. Always flush <br/>
    b. Sometimes a gap

    Ans: a


2. Extend flush

    We add a second style rule: p { padding: 20px; }. Will the background color still extend flush without a gap to the border?

    a. Yes, always flush <br/>

    c. With the additional style rule of background-repeat:no-repeat; we could potentially introduce a gap between the image and the border.

    Ans: ac


4. Larger

    If you need to make an element a little larger, which property should you use?

    Ans: padding or padding-left or padding-top or padding-right or padding-bottom


5. Extra space

    If a border or box-shadow is too snug to the content, what property can you use to get some extra space?

    Ans: padding or padding-left or padding-top or padding-right or padding-bottom


6. Padding property

    Will the padding property have any effect on the text-shadow property?

    Ans: No <br/>
    Explanation: The padding makes the box of an element bigger, and that can effect the box-shadow property, but has no effect upon the text-shadow property.


7. Negative padding

    Can negative padding be used to make an element smaller?

    Asn: No

### Pseudo classes and cursor

#### Refined CSS selectors - pseudo classes

If you have a page with some links on it, and you look at them carefully, you may notice that some of the links that you've visited before are a different color than those you haven't (purple versus blue, typically). Plus, if the mouse is brought over a link, it may change color again, or highlight in some other way. In addition, if you click down and don't let the mouse down, then maybe the link may change yet again. Lastly, if you visit some other sites and make these same explorations, you may observe visual differences from site to site. You may conclude that the styling of the elements are being changed, and you will be right. How did the author of the style sheet know which links you've been to already?

"Pseudo Classes" is a fancy term for simply being able to refine our CSS selection to something that isn't just another element. Pseudo Classes allow us to apply styles to the different states of an element. Or to various children of an element based on their index, or to other interactions with the browser. Best of all, pseudo classes are easy to use.

```css
a:visited { color: purple; }
```

Above us we see a tag selector (`a`) followed by a pseudo class, which consists of a colon and a word (e.g. `:visited`). This particular CSS rule will be applied to any `<a>` tag that the user has already visited. There can be no spaces on either side of the colon. Pseudo classes can be amended onto any CSS selector, not just tag selectors.

A full list of pseudo classes can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes). Let's look at some of the most common ones.

#### :visited

```css
a:visited { color: purple; }
```

The `:visited` pseudo class is usually put on a selector that resolves to an `<a>` tag. It enables you to define a style for the visited state of the link. For example, if the user has already been to that Web site, the `:visited` style will be applied.

#### :hover / :active

```css
li:hover  { background-color: red; }
li:active { background-color: green; }
```

The `:hover` pseudo class lets you change the style for an element when the mouse is hovering above it.  The `:active` pseudo class is applied when the mouse is depressed into its area.  Note that the mouse is rarely hovering or clicking over/into "just one" item. At any given moment, the mouse is usually over several elements, because if it is over a child element, it will be over the parent, grandparent, and great grandparent.  Therefore, if you have two different style rules, such as `li:hover` and `ul:hover`, then they will _both_ be activated,  when the mouse is over one of the list items.  


<table class="hov">
<tbody>
  <tr><th>CSS</th><th>Result (Try It!)</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><span style="color: #3366ff;">li</span>:hover  { <span style="color: #333399;">background-color</span>: <span style="color: #ff6600;">lightblue</span>; } <br/><span style="color: #3366ff;">li</span>:active { <span style="color: #333399;">background-color</span>: <span style="color: #ff6600;">red</span>;  }<br/><span style="color: #3366ff;">ul</span>:active { <span style="color: #333399;">border</span>: <span style="color: #339966;">1px</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">solid pink</span>; } </pre>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>shark</li>
        <li>marlin</li>
        <li>tuna</li>
        <li>whale</li>
        <li>koi</li>
        <li>barracuda</li>
        <li>octopus</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>


#### :nth-child

```css
tr:nth-child(odd)  { background-color: lightgray; }
tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: white; }
```

The `:nth-child` pseudo class is very handy.  Unlike the pseudo classes we've seen so far, it expects a parameter. The pseudo class always ends with a pair of parentheses with an expression inside.  This expression is simply the term odd or even, however, there are other more advanced possibilities with mathematical equations containing the term `n`.

This selector is most commonly used to apply "transaction ledger" styles to tables or lists.

<a href="url"> <br/>
    <img style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: black" src="images/m5-08.png" alt="Example of :nth-child(even)" title=":nth-child Example" width="300" >
</a>

#### Cursor property

```css
li { cursor: pointer; }
```

Since we've broached the topic of mouse-responding pseudo classes, it makes sense to also cover the `cursor` CSS property.

The cursor CSS property lets you change the cursor that is displayed when the mouse is over the element in question.  This does not have to be relegated to a `:hover` style, it can be applied anywhere. Though, if you want to change the cursor when an element is depressed,  set the `cursor` property in the context of an `:active` style. 

There are many possible values for the `cursor` property.  Their exact representation may vary slightly from browser to browser.  Common values include: `default`, `pointer`, `text`, `move` and `grab`.  (Hover over each value to see). In addition, some browsers support a custom image as well  ( `cursor: url("images/my_pointer.png"`); ).

For more information, please visit the [MDN page on cursor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor).

a. This cannot be achieved without JavaScript <br/>
b. mouseover { font-style: italic; } <br/>
c. a:hover { font-style:italic; } <br/>
d. a { font-style: italic; }

Ans: c

### CSS best practices

You will find below an excerpt of CSS best practices (see the [full slide set](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/best-practices/#title)) that were written by  Elika J. Etemad (also known as [fantasai](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/)). Elika is an expert on the [W3C CSS Working Group](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) (since 2004!) and a longtime contributor to the Mozilla Project. In addition to editing many of the CSS3 specifications, she’s worked on layout engine testing and development for Gecko and managing the CSS test suites at W3C.


#### Executive summary

+ __Logical source order__: <br/>
    The order of the HTML content should make sense even without the CSS: for accessibility, mobile optimization, device adaptability, and long-term maintainability.
+ __Liquid layouts and relativity__: <br/>
    Use smart relative sizing: to optimize layouts while minimizing media query code forks.
+ __Media queries__: <br/>
    Adapt to screen size changes; get font size adaptation free by using ems.
+ __Prevent zombie code__:
    Dead code may come alive as CSS changes. Delete it before it does, and ruins your layout.
+ __Test in multiple browsers__: <br/>
    Your favorite browser is not always right.
+ __Don't use proprietary features!__
    Keep the Web open to everyone! Don't rely on the latest -WebKit- invention.
+ __Turn off CSS__:
    A well-coded page will be understandable without it.


#### Foundations

+ Indent your code for readability ease
+ Learn how to code CSS before relying on frameworks (such as Bootstrap, etc.)
+ __Separate content and style__
  + Use semantic markup, ie., "classes for meaning, not for show". <br/>
    The following article is helpful to understand this concept: [Meaningful CSS: Style Like You Mean It](http://alistapart.com/article/meaningful-css-style-like-you-mean-it) (Tim Baxter, May 2016 - A list apart).
  + Use `<table>` for tabular data: don't use tables for layout, but if your content is tabular like a catalog, a calendar, or a price list, then the table element is the correct markup.
+ __Linearized logical source order__ <br/>
    The order of the HTML content should make sense even without the CSS. <br/>
    Benefits are numerous as it __works best__:
    + for long-term site maintainability
    + for mobile
    + for accessibility
    + as a foundation for device adaptation (media queries)
+ __Linguistic variations__: set the language correctly for better typography (see the section entitled "[why Internationalization is important](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+3T2017/courseware/8f5154ed51d0431ea5473cf0f8c287b3/8d4931e47ad24c74aac87e773cea2497/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B3T2017%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40ee99c75e1e9f42d4958ee79add48b2ee")


#### Testing

+ __Testing imageTest without CSS__: turn off CSS, and if the page makes no sense, fix your markup.
+ __Test in multiple environments__:
  + Resize the window
  + Zoom the text
  + Try a mobile browser
  + Navigate by keyboard
+ __Test in multiple browsers__: remember that just testing in Chrome does not work for everyone!  ;)


#### Adaptability

+ __Media queries__: set media query breakpoints in `em` or `ch`, not always in `px`.
+ __Liquid layouts and relativity__: what is your sizing based on?
    + Containing block size? → Use percents.
    + Viewport size? → Use viewport units: `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`
    + Font height? → Use `em` or `rem`.
    + Font pitch? → Use `em` or `ch`.
    + Content size? → Use `auto` or `min-content`/`max-content`.
    + Combination of the above? → Use the appropriate layout formulas: `flex`, `min-width`, `max-width`, etc.

Absolute units are usually the wrong answer.


#### Defensive Coding

+ `!important` means never override- to use with caution
    + Use `!important` to define overriding rules, not for fixups
    + Duplicate selectors if you need to increase specificity, or
    + Simplify selectors if you need to decrease specificity
+ __Don't over-escalate__: understand your code, and don't overkill. <br/>
    For example, avoid:
    >        . z-index: 9999999999999999999999999999999999999;
    >        . position: absolute; left: -10000000000px

+ __Drop dead code__: you tried something and it didn't work? Delete it right away!
+ Code to Standard
+ Don't rely on proprietary extensions
+ Don't use experimental features in production or commit to keeping up-to-date.
+ Provide fallbacks / use @supports.

### Recipe project - Module 5 and discussion

Let's up some of our code, as well as improve the look and feel of our Web page! Try moving all of your CSS code to a separate file (don't forget to link to it).

We're also going to make the nav element move out of the way when we're not using it, so that it only slides out when we're hovering on it.

Finally, we'll convert the Ingredients list to a table with ingredients and amounts.

Give it a try, and when you're done (or if you get stuck), watch the video below to see what we did.

## 5.6 Exercises - Module 5

### Tables exercises (1-12)

1. Table vs layout?

    Why shouldn't tables be used for layout? (select all that apply - 2 correct answers!)

    a. Though tables were initially designed for layout, the new specification encourages it only for tabular data <br/>
    b. Tables are not screen reader friendly <br/>
    c. Tables take a long time to create <br/>
    d. Tables are harder to style <br/>
    e. Redesigning your page is harder <br/>

    Ans: be <br/>
    Explanation: Since layout is considered presentation code, your HTML will be cluttered with code other than content. To change the page style, you have to edit the entire HTML including table structure and content. Sceen readers also find it harder to read content in tables. Tables were never designed for layout. They were being misused for a while for layout but that is changing.


2. I'm first!

    Which one of these open tags should come before the others in a table element? (`<table>`)?

    a. th <br/>
    b. tr <br/>
    c. td <br/>
    d. tc

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: Tables in HTML5 are described by defining rows, 'td' and 'th' are elements within rows and there is no 'tc'.


3. Organization

    How are HTML5 elements of a table organized?

    a. A figure contains a table which contains data cells <br/>
    b. A table contains rows and each row contains data cells <br/>
    c. A table contains a div which contains rows or columns <br/>
    d. A table contains columns and each column contains rows

    Ans: b <br>
    Explanation: In HTML5, rows are specified and cells in each row correspond to columns.


4. Size matters

    True or False? Every data cell in a table will be the same size (same height and width).

    Ans: False <br/>
    Explanation: Different cells can be different widths and heights, depending on content and CSS styling.


5. Same?

    True or False? `<th>` is just a shorter way to write `<thead>`

    Ans: False <br/>
    Explanation: 'thead', 'tbody' and 'tfoot' describe different portions of the table, while 'th' is typically for column names and usually styled different from 'td'.


6. Order is important

    Which of these is the correct order of elements in a table?

    a. `<tr>` goes inside `<th>` <br/>
    b. `<thead>` goes inside `<th>` <br/>
    c. `<th>` goes inside `<tr>` <br/>
    d. `<thead>` goes inside `<tr>`

    Ans: c <br/>
    Explanation: Like 'td' elements, 'th' cells go in rows, described by 'tr'.


7. Table title

    Which tag do you use to give your table a title?

    a. `<thead>`...`</thead>` <br/>
    b. `<caption>`...`</caption>` <br/>
    b. `<table>`...`</table>` <br/>
    d. `<title>`...`</title>`

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: The caption element that takes one or more lines of text is used to give title to a table.


8. Using 'span'

    What is the `span` attribute in 'colgroup' and 'col' elements used for?

    a. Indicates that any styles applied to the elements will be applied to the rest of the table <br/>
    b. To specify the number of rows you want the cell element to span or cover <br/>
    c. To specify the number of columns you want the colgroup or col element to span or cover <br/>
    d. To specify that the column will be a header column

    Ans: c <br/>
    Explanation: 'span' as the name suggests, when used in 'colgroup' and 'col', specifies the number of columns you want the element to span.


9. Table 

    Why should you split your table into header, body and footer using the `thead`, `tbody` and `tfoot` elements? (check all that apply - 2 correct answers!)

    a. Header, body and footer rows can be styled individually <br/>
    b. Browser needs to know header, body and footer of a table to display a table correctly <br/>
    c. Body can be scrolled independently of header and footer <br/>
    d. You cannot use `<th>` without `<thead>`

    Ans: ac <br/>
    Explanation: Not only can table head, body and footer be styled individually but using CSS/JavaScript you can also design the body of your table to be scrolled independently of the table header and footer. The `<th>` and `<td>` tags can be used regardless of whether `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` are used in a table. The browser also does not depend on the `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` tags to display a table.


10. 'th' tag

    By default, contents of the `<th>` tag are displayed as?

    a. regular and center aligned <br/>
    b. regular and left aligned <br/>
    c. bold and center aligned <br/>
    d. bold and left aligned

    Ans: c <br/>
    Explanation: Contents `<th>` tags are bold and centered by default. They are header cells. Contents of regular data cells using `<td>` are regular and left aligned by default.


11. Header and data cells

    ```html
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    ```

    True or False? The `<th>` and `<td>` tags can be used in the same row. (Refer to code above)

    Ans: True <br/>
    Explanation: You can mix table header and data cells in the same row. It is valid though very uncommon.


12. Border-Collapse

    Why is the CSS 'border-collapse' property used in tables?

    a. There is no such CSS property <br/>
    b. They were specifially created to allow tables to have double borders <br/>
    c. For multiple tables to share borders with each other <br/>
    d. If table and cells have individual borders, they can be kept separate or combined into one border between them

    Ans: d <br/>
    Explanation: If a table and its cells both have borders, it will create a double border. The 'separate' value keeps the double border. The 'collapse' value combines them into a single border.


### Multimedia exercises (13-20)

13. Cats and dogs

    Suppose I've got a cat video but I want to trick people into thinking it's a dog video. Is it possible to set it up so that the 'cover' picture is a picture of a dog for my cat video?

    a. Yes, by using multiple `<source>` attributes <br/>
    b. No, there's no way to do that <br/>
    c. Yes, by setting the 'poster' attribute to point to a picture of a dog <br/>
    d. Yes, but the only way to do it is to edit the video so that the first frame is a picture of a dog

    Ans: c <br/>
    Explanation: The 'poster' attribute determines the 'cover' picture, and it can be a frame from the video or an arbitrary image.


14. Auto play

    True or False? To make the video start playing automatically when visiting your Web site, you would use the 'preload' attribute.

    Ans: False <br/>
    Explication: 'preload' downloads the video so there is less delay when the user plays it, sort of like getting a head start.


15. Audio 

    Which of the following is correct if you want your audio to have controls, play sound once playback begins and indicate to the browser that the audio file should be loaded when the page loads?

    a. `<audio src="sounds/guitar.mp3" controls muted preload="metada"></audio>` <br/>
    b. `<audio src="sounds/guitar.mp3" controls preload="auto"></audio>` <br/>
    c. `<audio src="sounds/guitar.mp3" controls muted preload="auto"></audio>` <br/>
    d. `<audio src="sounds/guitar.mp3" controls preload="none"></audio>`

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: 'controls' is a boolean attribute that will add controls to the multimedia player. 'muted' is also a boolean attribute that will mute that audio when playback begins. So in this case, it should not be specified. The preload value 'auto' will indicate the file should be loaded when page loads while 'none' indicates file should not loaded.


16. Lossy compression

    The most common compression technique for multimedia on the Web is lossy compression. Why? (select all that apply - 3 correct answers!)

    a. It is the easiest to work with providing most number of tools for compression <br/>
    b. It offers the smallest file size decreasing load time <br/>
    c. Loss in quality can be made insignificant by selecting different compression rates <br/>
    d. Browsers prefer working with files that are heavily compressed <br/>
    e. Loss in quality is not as significant in multimedia as it is in documents

    Ans: bcs <br/>
    Explanation: Using lossy compression, file size is the smallest as it is more compressed. Using tools for compression, you can customize the rate of compression and decide on the final quality. Loss in some quality in audio and video is mostly reducing redundant data which is often not noticed by the user. In documents, it is more of a concern if text is lost.


17. Track element

    Which attribute do you use to specify the type of source file you are using in your track element? i.e. captions, subtitles, descriptions, etc.

    a. srclang <br/>
    b. srctype <br/>
    c. kind <br/>
    d. type

    Ans: c <br/>
    Explanation: You use the 'kind' attribute to specify the purpose of source file in your track element.


18. Different sources

    Why would a `<video>` tag contain 3 different `<source>` tags?

    a. To provide close captioning <br/>
    b. To allow for different format capabilities. Not every browser can play every type of video format. <br/>
    c. So the user can choose between the three <br/>
    d. So it can play three videos in sequence

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: Because there is no universally accepted video format, the <source> tag provides 'fallback' alternatives in case the browser doesn't support a particular video format or codec.


19. Multiple tracks

    True or False? You can add multiple `<track>` tags in your video element.

    Ans: True <br/>
    Explanation: You can add multiple <track> tags in your 'video' element for multiple subtitle/caption tracks.


20. Captions file type

    Which of the following file types is the standard for captions and subtitles for your video using the 'track' element?

    a. Structured Subtitle Format <br/>
    b. Web Video Text Tracks <br/>
    c. MPSub <br/>
    d. SubRip

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: For use in the 'track' element, Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT) with the file extension .vtt is the standard. Files of other formats can often be converted to WebVTT.


### CSS exercises (21-25)

21. Mirror, beautiful mirror

    The Web page you are developing needs to include a picture of the author. How should that image be incorporated into the page?

    a. `<img>` in HTML <br/>
    b. background-image in CSS

    Ans: a <br/>
    Explanation: The picture of the author is substantive: it is semantically important, it is content. It is not merely decoration that could be re-used with a different page. Therefore, it should be included via the HTML, not the CSS. And to place an image on the page with HTML we use the `<img>` tag.


22. Stage curtains

    The Web site you are developing needs to place an image of stage curtains behind each article. How should that image be incorporated into the page?

    a. background-image in CSS <br/>
    b. `<img>` in HTML

    Ans: a <br/>
    Explanation: The picture of stage curtains are not substantive to understanding the article, they are entirely decorative. As decorative images, they should put on the page using CSS. And when using CSS, we include images via the background-image property.


23. Give me some space

  If the border you are applying is too close to the content, what property can you use to give it some extra space?
  
  Ans:padding <br/>
  Explanation: The padding property will make an element larger that its base content. And this will also put space between the content of an element and its border.


24. Is that acceptable?

    Which of the following are acceptable values for the background-color property? (select all that apply - 5 correct answers!)

    a. rgba(100, 200, 0, 0.5)  <br/>
    b. #5580F2 <br/>
    c. orange <br/>
    d. rgb(1000, 200, 100)

    Ans: abcef <br/>
    Explanation: There are many different ways of defining a color for CSS. The only option above that isn't correct is rgb(1000, 200, 100) because 1000 is out side the range of rgb values, which should be from 0 to 255.


25. Border style

    Which of the following is NOT a valid setting for border-style?

    a. double
    b. triple
    c. groove
    d. solid
    e. dotted

    Ans: b <br/>
    Explanation: There is no 'triple' border-style. You can do interesting things with gradients though.
