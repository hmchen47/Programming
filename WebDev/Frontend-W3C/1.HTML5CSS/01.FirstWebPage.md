## 1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

### Vague but exciting!

Twenty eight years ago today, a proposal was sent internally at CERN outlying a universal linked information system. Dubbed 'Information Management: A proposal', pictured below, the proposal was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall, who described it as 'vague but exciting'.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/633117d2ef0f4bb59cda68d966b6d288/9ad1671507944d7e8193a3ed18ca622f/?child=first">

</a>

Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for universality enabled the development of a high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any other documents.

The World Wide Web was initially created to make it easier to share research papers. It is a system of interlinked ‘hypertext’ documents that are accessed via the Internet; in essence, an information space. While he did not invent hypertext systems, Berners-Lee proposed using them 'to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.'

His breakthrough was to link hypertext to the Internet and he used three technologies to do this:

+ HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the Web.
+ HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main mark-up language for creating Web pages and information that can be displayed on a Web browser.
+ Web addresses or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are used to reference a Web page.

In the following pages, we present HTML through what is usually called the big 3 (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript), the hypertext concept and the browser, an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.


### HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

#### What is HTML5?

When people say 'HTML5', they usually mean a bit more than just the 5th version of the "HyperText Markup Language". Modern Web pages and Web applications are generally composed of at least three components, so what people often mean when they say 'HTML5' is the trio of languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc.

While there have been numerous versions of HTML since its inception, our focus in this course is the most recent version, HTML5. HTML5 was developed to provide more powerful and flexible ways for developers to create dynamic Web pages.

#### CSS

The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content. We'll be going into more detail on that later in this course, but for now, think of it as the way you might specify a "theme" in a word processing document, setting fonts, sizes, indentations and whatever else may apply to what it looks like.

#### JavaScript

The 'JavaScript', or 'JS' for short, part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application, with nearly unlimited possibilities.  We will not be doing much with JavaScript in this course, but you should know that it is an important leg of the stool for modern Web pages.


### Hypertext

A fundamental key to the World Wide Web is the concept of "_Hypertext_".  Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together, not unlike using footnotes, except much easier and more flexible. The idea was to "Mark Up" your document with links and define how to break it down into different segments (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.)

That's why, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee began to create a definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate Hyperlinks in a text document.

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/633117d2ef0f4bb59cda68d966b6d288/9ad1671507944d7e8193a3ed18ca622f/?child=first">

</a>

He envisioned a technology that would facilitate thoroughly interconnected documents. He wanted authors to be able to connect an idea in one document to the source of the idea in another, or connect a statement with the data that backs up that statement. Traditionally, this kind of thing was done with footnotes and bibliographies, which can be cumbersome. This information should be easily transferable from one place to another, so that in reading one document, it is easy to access everything related (linked) to it. Tim Berners-Lee imagined a "Web" of interconnected documents.

He used the metaphor of a Web to emphasize the importance of connections between documents. It was not just a long list of details, but rather a sea of information stretching out in all directions. This sea of information was navigated by a new tool called a "Browser".

#### Knowledge check 1.2.3

True or False: The primary purpose of HTML is to assist formatting of text.

    Ans: False - links

### The browser

The Internet existed long before the Web came to fruition, and lots of organizations were connected to it, including schools, companies and government organizations.  As things progressed through the 80's, the Internet was used for file transfers, newsgroups (a kind of open forum), email and other conveniences.

At the time there were a number of different programs like '[fetch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(FTP_client))', '[gopher](http://www.yourdictionary.com/gopher#Noun-3)' and '[archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine)' that were used to download, browse and search for files.  Typically, you might use one tool to search for the location of files of interest, then another to copy that file to a local machine.  Then, you still needed more tools to read that file.  If it was text, you could use a text editor, if it was a formatted document you might need a word processor, if a picture you would need an image viewer and so on.

[Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) conceived of a solution that would put all the pieces together in one app, making it easy for users to browse all the different sorts of information and data on the World Wide Web.  Together with others, he started the "Mosaic" project.

Though not technically the first browser, Mosaic was the first one that many people experienced and played a big part in popularizing the concept of the World Wide Web and the Web browser. It provided a simple graphical way to access and browse the various resources on the Internet. Instead of using different tools to download and view information on the Internet, a simple click on a link would present the information in a graphical window. In many ways, it is the ancestor of most modern browsers.

### Activity - Explore the Web

Exploring the Web, "Then and Now":
+ Go to [archive.org](https://archive.org/) and find the earliest instance of the Web site: www.google.com.
+ Note the differences between that and its current Web site.
+ Find an old news story, see how far back you can go (hint: start by looking at yahoo.com).
+ In general, what differences do you notice between Web sites from the 90's and Web sites today?
+ Post your observations and findings in the discussion forum below.


## 1.3 Elements, tags and attributes

### Putting the "M" in HTML

So the "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean? Essentially, it means to annotate a document with extra information. Things like where different sections and paragraphs begin and end, which part is the title, which things should be emphasized and so on.  

There are many ways to markup a document, but HTML borrows a technique from an ancestor language, SGML ([Standard Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language)), which uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") to separate the annotations from the regular text.  In HTML these annotations are called "tags".

For example, consider the following chunk of HTML code:
```html
   <body>
      <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
      <p>
         It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . .
      </p>
      . . .
      <p>
         . . . it is a far, far better rest
         that I go to than I have ever known.
      </p>
   </body>
```

If you eliminated everything in between the angle brackets from the text, for most purposes it would still read the same:

```
A Tale of Two Cities
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . .
  . . .
. . . it is a far, far better rest
    that I go to than I have ever known.
```

Once you know that everything in angle brackets is "__meta-information__", it leaves a lot of flexibility. You can put a lot of different things in between those brackets without any of it showing up (directly) in your finished document. And, though you don't usually see directly what's in those angle brackets, they can often have a big effect on what your Web page looks like as well as how it responds and interacts with you.

#### Try It Out!

I expect at this point you may be longing to write some HTML code.  As is the tradition in programming tutorials, we'll pause here to create a simple "Hello HTML" program. Please choose any [Web editor](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+3T2017/courseware/76828eeb1b274f478c1dce2b9ef2148e/a780a4d629bd4cb48c847760e47aa40a/2) of your liking.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget). But it's better to use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.

### Programming "Hello HTML"!

You can build and edit your HTML pages by either using online editors or editors that you can install on your machine like Visual Studio Code.

#### Using online editors:

Both JSBin and CodePen are two online editors that you can use to create HTML Web pages. The following two videos show you how to create your first HTML page using JSBin and CodePen

### Elements

If you are sitting at a coffee shop next to a table of Web developers, you will probably hear three words quite a bit: '__Tags__', '__Attributes__' and '__Elements__' (or sometimes 'DOM elements', same thing just more precise and wordy).

'Elements' are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element.  Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header elements, paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the DOM.

<svg width="600" height="300"><g transform="translate(120,20)"><path class="link" d="M0,117C90,117 90,52 180,52"></path><path class="link" d="M0,117C90,117 90,182 180,182"></path><path class="link" d="M180,182C270,182 270,156 360,156"></path><path class="link" d="M180,182C270,182 270,208 360,208"></path><path class="link" d="M180,52C270,52 270,52 360,52"></path><g class="node" transform="translate(0,117)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">html</text></g><g class="node" transform="translate(180,182)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">body</text></g><g class="node" transform="translate(180,52)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">head</text></g><g class="node" transform="translate(360,208)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">p</text></g><g class="node" transform="translate(360,156)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">h1</text></g><g class="node" transform="translate(360,52)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(211, 211, 211);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">title</text></g></g></svg>

Consider the figure above.  It contains a single 'html' element.  It turns out this includes within it the entire content of your html file.  If you click on the "html" node, you'll find that it contains two components, a head and a body.  Clicking on each of those will reveal their respective contents.  This structure is what we computer scientists call a "tree".  Any given element (except for the outermost 'html' element) is wholly contained inside another element, referred to as the "parent" element.  Not surprisingly, the elements that a given element contains are its "child" elements.  And, yes, children of a common parent are often referred to as "siblings".

Thus in the example above, the top element is the html element, which contains just two elements, the head and body.  The head element contains a title element and the body contains an 'h1' element and a 'p' element.  In a more typical example, the body would contain many more children, but for our purpose this is enough.

That may be a great picture, but how do we represent such a structure in a text file?  Well, that's where "tags" come in.


### Tags

'Tags' are what we use to organize a text file (which is just a long string of characters) such that it represents a tree of elements that make up the html document.  Tags are not the elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element begins and ends.  When you 'mark up' a document, you generally don't want those extra notes that are not really part of the text to be presented to the reader. HTML borrows a technique from another language, SGML, to provide an easy way for a computer to determine which parts are "MarkUp" and which parts are the content. By using `<` and `>` as a kind of parentheses, HTML can indicate the beginning and end of a tag, i.e. the presence of `<` tells the browser 'this next bit is markup, pay attention'.

Whatever that tag (or 'open tag') does, it applies to the content following the tag. Unless you want that to be the entire rest of the document, you need to indicate when to stop using that tag and do something else, so `<` and `>` are again used. Since elements are typically nested within other elements, the browser needs to be able to distinguish between the end of the current tag or the beginning of a new tag (representing a nested element). This is done by adding a `/` right after the `<` to indicated that it's a 'close tag'. To indicate the beginning and end of a paragraph (indicated by the single letter `p`) you end up with something like this:

```html
<p>This is my first paragraph!</p>
```

The browser sees the letters `<p>` and decides 'A new paragraph is starting, I'd better start a new line and maybe indent it'. Then when it sees `</p>` it knows that the paragraph it was working on is finished, so it should break the line there before going on to whatever is next.

For example, the `<em>` tag is used for element that needs Emphasis.  The  `<` and `>` indicate that this is a tag, and the "little bits of text" in between tell us what kind of tag it is.  To completely describe the element, it needs an open and close tag, with everything in between the tags is the contents of the element:

<a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+2T2018/courseware/633117d2ef0f4bb59cda68d966b6d288/f36ef1f210bf460e9e0f43be78fb0bd5/?child=first">

</a>

Most tags have open and close versions, but there are a few strange ones.  We'll learn more about these later, but we generally refer to the strange ones as "self closing" tags.   Usually these tags represent an element that is completely described by its attributes, and thus there is no need for other content.  So if you see something like this:

```html
<img src="https://goo.gl/pVxY0e" alt="Floating Flower"/>
```

... then you should know that the slash at the end of the open tag is sort of a shorthand for a close tag, so you won't see any other indication that this element is now complete.  There are also a few tags that don't even use the `/` at the end, they just don't have any close tag at all.  This works because all of the information this tag needs is declared in an "attribute".

#### Knowledge check 1.3.4

Which is the correct nesting of these elements?

a. "p" inside "body" inside "html" <br/>
b. "html" inside "body" inside "p" <br/>
c. "p" inside "body" inside "head"

Ans: a

### Comments

Computers are great at reading computer languages, but it's not always easy for humans.  Comments are a way of adding some text that is primarily targeted towards human readers.

Every programming language I've used has some way of representing comments.  HTML5 is no exception.  If you want to add something in your file that you want the browser to completely ignore, there's a special tag for that (unsurprisingly called a "comment tag"):

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

An HTML comment tag starts with `<!--' and ends with '-->`, meaning that as the computer is reading through your HTML file, if it sees `<!--` it will ignore everything it sees until it comes across `-->`.  There is no open or close tag, just a comment tag.  Unlike most other things in HTML5, comments cannot be nested.  If you try that, like:

```html
<!--
Beginning of comment
  <!-- comment nested inside -->
This is after the nested comment
-->
```

Then the computer will see the beginning of the comment tag and start ignoring everything until it sees `-->`, including the second `<!--`.  Once it sees `-->` it assumes the comment is done and goes back to processing everything it sees as HTML code and content, even though the writer may have meant it to be a comment.

Like most other tags, it can span multiple lines of your source file.  This can be really convenient when you have a lot to say:

```html
<!--
If you want some good advice,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
-->
```

Comments are also commonly used in development to block out bits of code, whether for testing or leaving unfinished business in the file:

```html
<!-- Not sure if I want this wording or not:
<p>Eighty seven years ago, a bunch of guys started a new country</p>
-->
```

It's important to remember that just as HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three different languages, they each have their own way of writing comments.  This might seem confusing, but it's actually kind of important that the HTML comments, at least, differ from the others.  As for the exact form of those comments, we'll cover that in good time.

### Attributes

Most of what we'll cover about attributes will come later, but I wanted to introduce the idea briefly. Basically, a given element on your Web page can be distinguished by any number of unique or common attributes.  You can identify it uniquely with an 'id' attribute, or group it with a class of other elements by setting the 'class' attribute.

Attributes in HTML are written inside the opening tag like this:

```html
<p id="paragraph-1" class="regular-paragraphs">
   Call me Ishmael . . .
 </p>
 ```

The paragraph above has a unique identifier, "paragraph-1" and is part of a class of "regular-paragraphs". The letters inside the quotes have no meaning to the computer, they just need to be consistent. They are actually strings, which, as we will soon learn, suggest that if you want to have another paragraph in this class, it has to say "regular-paragraphs", not "regular" or "Regular-Paragraphs" or any other variation.

Again, the fact that the computer does not care what we put in those strings (except for some restrictions) means we can use them to convey meaning to a human developer. I could just as easily have said id='x' and class='y', but anyone looking at that would have no hint what the significance of x and y are. Best practice is to __name these things to increase clarity, consistency and brevity__.

But more about attributes in the next module.


### All together now!

One key to understanding HTML, or any computer language, is to be sure that you avoid ambiguity, because computers generally are not good at judgement calls. For example, you could streamline HTML so that whenever you see a `<p>` tag, you start a new paragraph, no close tag needed. That might work most of the time, but that would prevent you from nesting one element inside another, as the computer could not know if you meant the new element to be nested or a successor.

A human designer might be able to tell what you meant from the context, and knowing that mistakes happen choose the one she thinks is best suited in that case. A computer, on the other hand, has difficulty with a task like that, so it is helpful to use a close tag that matches the open tag to make things absolutely clear.

```html
<p>
    The old lady pulled her spectacles
down and looked over them about the
room; then she put them up and looked
out under them.

    There was a slight noise behind her
and she turned just in time to seize a
small boy by the slack of his roundabout
and arrest his flight.
</p>
```

> The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.

A human reader could easily detect that two paragraphs were intended and that the writer probably just forgot to terminate one and start the other. The computer, on the other hand, will only see one paragraph and layout accordingly.

On the other hand, you might think that since a computer always knows exactly what tag it is working with (eidetic memory), you could provide a sort of "universal close tag" that doesn't specify the type that it's closing. It would know to close the current tag. While that's technically true, it's handy to have the close tag there for people reading the code. The close tag makes it easier to remember what tag it is closing. We humans can get confused trying to remember that kind of detail.

But there are other ambiguities to consider. For example, when a browser receives a file, it may know that it's receiving an HTML file, but it won't know which version of HTML is used (it matters).  

That's why __the first thing you need in any HTML file__ is a tag to tell you what type of HTML file it is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

In other words, the first thing the browser sees is the declaration "This is an HTML5 file, in case you were wondering". It may seem tedious to put this at the top of every file, but believe me, it used to be worse.  You probably noticed that it doesn't say "!DOCTYPE HTML5" but just "html".

HTML5 can do this because all the previous versions were much more long winded.  For example, at the top of an HTML 4.01 page, you might have something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

We do not need to go into the details of why and what that means, just be grateful that HTML5 did away with it.

#### Everything in HTML

It may seem redundant, but the next bit tells the computer where the actual HTML code begins, using an `<html>` tag:

```html
<html>
```

Nearly every HTML document has two parts. The 'body' is the main content of the page, containing text, images, tables and so on. The 'head' comes before the 'body' (on top?). It is where you put information about the document that does not really go in the body, AKA 'meta-' information. Things like what kind of character set the page is using, where the browser can find style tips, and what the title of the page is (which might be different from the title the user reads) all go in the `<head>`. If you have been paying attention, you should be able to create a very basic html file, in the right form, without any content. Hint, for the head of the document you would write:

```html
<head>
 
</head>
```

You may recall the paragraph tag `<p>` that we used in the example above. Try inserting a paragraph into the body of your new document.  You should end up with something that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
   </head>
   <body>
     <p>
       As my English teacher used to say, 'One sentence does not a paragraph make'!
     </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

## 1.4 Character encoding

### Character encoding

A character can be any letter, digit or symbol that makes up words and languages. English alphabets and digits 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9' are all considered characters. Other examples of characters include the Latin letter á or the Chinese ideograph 請 or the Devanagari character ह. A __character set__ is a collection of characters (letters and symbols) in a writing system.

Each character is assigned a particular number called a __code point__. These code points are stored in computer memory in the form of [bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) (a unit of data in computer memory). In technical terms, we say the character is __encoded__ using one or more bytes.

Basically, all the characters are stored in computer language and a __character encoding__ is the awesome dictionary that is going to help us decode this computer language into something we can understand. In technical terms, it is what is used as a reference to map code points into bytes to store in computer memory; then when you use a character in your HTML, the bytes are then read back into code points using the character encoding as a reference.

Examples of character encodings include:

+ _ASCII_: contains letters, characters and a limited set of symbols and punctuation for the English language
+ _Windows-1252 (Latin1)_: Windows character set that supports 256 different code points
+ _ISO-8859-6_: contains letters and symbols based on the Arabic script
+ _Unicode_: contains characters for most living languages and scripts in the world

When you code in HTML, you must specify the encoding you wish your page to use. Providing no encoding or the wrong one is pretty much like providing the wrong dictionary to decode. It can display your text incorrectly or cause your data to not be read correctly by a search engine. A character encoding declaration in your HTML is also important to process unfamiliar characters entered in forms by users, URLs generated by scripts, etc.

__You should always use the Unicode character encoding UTF-8 for your Web pages__, and avoid 'legacy' encodings such as ASCII, Windows-1252 and ISO-8859-6 mentioned above. Do not use the UTF-16 Unicode encoding either.

It is important to note that it is not enough to simply declare your encoding at the top of the web page. __You have to ensure that your editor saves the file in UTF-8__ also. Most editors will do that these days, but you should check.

Read an [Introduction to character sets and encodings here](https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/characters).


### Declaring the encoding of the page: the `<meta>` tag

Use the `<meta>` element with the `charset` attribute in your HTML page to indicate to the browser the character encoding you will be using in the page.

<pre>
<b style="color:darkblue"> &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; </b>
</pre>

Alternatively, you can also use `http-equiv` and `content` attributes. 

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
```

We recommend using the first one because it is much less complicated. You should also always use 'utf-8'.

#### Where to place it?

The meta declaration belongs inside the `<head>` element, and should be specified within the first 1024 bytes of your page. So the earlier it is mentioned in your code, the better. 

W3C recommends placing it immediately after the opening <head> tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    ...
  </head>
</html>
```

### HTML character references

#### Why we need character references

Before we learn what HTML character references are, let's look at how the need for them came about.

Try the following code in your HTML:

```html
<p>Welcome to "HTML5 & CSS Fundamentals". The first tag we will be learning about is the <html> tag.</p>
```

Code in CodePen: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Welcome</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Welcome to "HTML5 & CSS Fundamentals". The first tag we will be learning about is the
    <html> tag.</p>
</body>

</html>
```

Result in CodePen: 
> Welcome to "HTML5 & CSS Fundamentals". The first tag we will be learning about is the tag.

Did you notice the `<html>` tag is missing in your output? In this case, your browser mixed it up with an actual tag, although it was meant to be a part of the sentence as text. 

Because of this kind of confusion, HTML reserves certain characters. If you want to use these characters in your HTML, you need to use character references to display them.

#### How to use character references

All HTML character references can be written using either a name or number.

If you want to use a __named character reference__ in your source code, use an ampersand symbol '&', followed by the name and a semi-colon. Names are case sensitive. For example, the following represents a no-break space: `&nbsp;`

There are two types of __numeric character reference__: ones that use decimal numbers and ones that use hexadecimal numbers.  In each case, the number represents the code point number of the character in Unicode.

If you are using a decimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbol '#', then a decimal number and a semi-colon.

```html
&#160;
```

If you are using a hexadecimal number, use an ampersand symbol '&' , followed by the symbols '#x', then a hexadecimal number and a semi-colon.

```html
&#x00A0;
```

#### Protecting characters used for HTML syntax

The five special characters listed in the table below should always be written as character references if you want them to appear on your page when viewed by a reader:

| Symbol | Entity Name | Entity Number | Usage |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Less than '<' | `&lt;` | `&#60;` | Div tag: `&lt;` |
| Greater than '>' | `&gt;` | `&#62;` | Div tag: `&lt;div&gt;` |
| Ampersand '&' | `&amp;` | `&#38;` | `Tom &amp; Jerry` |
| Non-breaking space - space that will not create a new line | `&nbsp;` | `&#160;` | If you add multiple spaces, the browser will remove all but one. So you have to use this entity to add multiple spaces in your HTML page. |
| Quotes " | `&quot;` | `&#34;` | Link to a another section on the same page using the id of the element: `&lt;a href=&quot;&num;timetable&quot;&gt;` <br/> Displayed as: `<a href="#timetable">` <br/> `&quot;` is generally encouraged for code. For an actual quotation, `<q>` or `<blockquote>` is preferred. |

We do not want these special characters to be processed by the browser as HTML code. Instead, you want it to be displayed to the user. So if you wish to display this in your browser:

```html
<img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">
```

You have to write it like this in your HTML code:

```html
&lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;
```

Code in CodePen:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
    
<body>
   <p>
      <img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">  
  </P>
  <p>
     &lt;img src=&quot;images/test.png&quot; alt=&quot;test image&quot;&gt;
  </p>  
</body>

</html>
```

Result from CodePen:
```html
test image

<img src="images/test.png" alt="test image">
```

Some tolerant browsers will allow using the '&' character directly but not all. So you should use its character reference `&amp;`. [Check out these examples](https://jsfiddle.net/vh2h7usk/1/) illustrating the importance of using the character entity `&amp;` for &.

While it might be tempting to not use one of these character references when you notice that the browser produces the expected result anyway, it is a best practice to use character references for these five special characters using `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&amp`; and `&nbsp;` at all times.  This is because you can never be sure what browser or application will be used to view your code, and how that will behave.

The `&quot;` character reference is particularly useful for quotation marks within attribute values. Let's say you want to add a title attribute to an abbreviation to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. If you try the code below in a browser and hover your mouse pointer on the text 'HTML5', it will show you the title text (it works like a tooltip). The title text in the source code includes quotes (around the number 5) like this:

```html
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language "5"">HTML5</abbr>
```

The above will not display the number 5.

Replacing the quotes with its character entity will work:

```html
<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language &quot;5&quot;">HTML5</abbr>
```

#### Knowledge check 1.4.3

What is the output for the code below?

```html
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading &amp; it is the &quot;biggest&quot; one in this page&gt;/h1&lt; 
```

a. This is a heading & it is the "biggest" one in this page <br/>
b. `<h1>This is a heading & it is the "biggest" one in this page</h1>`  <br/>
c. `&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading & it is the &quot; biggest&quot; one in this page &gt;/h1&lt;` <br/>
d. `<h1>This is a heading & it is the "biggest" one in this page</h1>`

Ans: b


### Character references for other characters

It is also possible to use character references to represent other characters in your page. This is useful when you are unable to type the character itself, or when you can't tell what the character is by looking at it (for example, a no-break space, or an invisible formatting character).

There are predefined, named character references in HTML for several categories, these include:

+ currency symbols
+ copyright, trademark and registered symbol
+ general punctuation
+ arrows
+ mathematical symbols
+ Greek letters

For a list of __named__ character references available in HTML, visit:  https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref.

Any Unicode character can be represented using a __numeric__ character reference.

Apart from the characters used for HTML syntax (described in the previous unit), there is usually no need to use character references to represent characters.  All browsers are built using Unicode internally, which means that they are capable of handling all possible characters defined by Unicode. So, the best practice for symbols like copyright, currency symbols, math and arrows is to simply type them directly into the source code.

You can do this directly in the code: `<p>This is © 2015. Breach will entail a fine of € 400</p>`

HTML Code in CodePen: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
    
<body>
       <p>This is © 2015. Breach will entail a fine of € 400</p>
 
  
</body>

</html>
```

Result from CodePen:
> This is © 2015. Breach will entail a fine of € 400>

There is no need for the `&copy;` or `&euro;` HTML character reference if you are able to type the character itself.

If you'd like to read more information about when to use character references and when not to use them, see [Using character escapes in markup and CSS](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-escapes).



## 1.5 Best practices

### Learning from the mistakes others have 

Children can be great at asking questions about things that most adults take for granted, and like to challenge assumptions.

While it's a great sign of a curious and reasoning mind, it can be overwhelming, and you can't really learn (or teach) everything at once.  Some things are better to be taken on faith in the short term, until you fully understand the issue.

That brings up a term you'll be hearing quite a bit in this class: "__best practices__".  It's often said that bad programs can be written in any language, and we've found that to be true (at least in every language we've seen).  Over time, developers learn that some habits are better than others, in other words that some habits , like [avoiding redundancy and repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), tend to make a program more clear and easier to understand and maintain than other habits, like [using goto statements](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF).  It could also be about performance, i.e. in a given language doing a task one way may be faster than another.

A carpenter will tell you that if you want to hammer a nail, it's best to do it in as few strikes as possible (e.g. 2 or 3).  That may not be obvious to non-handy people like me, but I've been told that's the best way by people with a lot more experience than I, so I'll take it on faith (at least for now).

There are sometimes arguments about which are the best practices.  New techniques are discovered, new ideas are born, and sometimes, fashions change. For our purposes and the duration of this course, when we use the term "best practice" you can trust that it is, even though we may not be able to explain it at that point in the course, so you'll want to make it a habit.


### Do's and don'

The history of Web pages is such that browsers tend to be very forgiving of certain types of mistakes. If you miss a closing tag, it will often work the way you expect. It probably won't crash, or ignore the document, or give up completely, but it might not appear quite the way you meant it to. Or maybe it does look like you want, but you do not want to depend on that. In general, best practices would call for one to do it properly, and not depend on the browser to patch it for you.

Because an HTML file essentially represents a tree structure, the open and close tags should always match, and there should not be any overlap with other elements. That is, you can have an element that is enclosed in another element, or you can have two elements side-by-side, but you can never have a situation in which part of an element is in another, but the other part is not.

```html
<p>This is a <em>paragraph</em></p>
<h1>Paragraph ahead</h1>
<p>And here it is.</p>
```

The two examples above are fine because in each case either an element is wholly contained in another (`<em>` in `<p>`) or they are completely separate (`<h1>` and `<p>`).  This, on the other hand, is not valid:

```html
<h1>Part of this header is<p>in the</h2> paragraph below</p>
```

What happens in this case is what we call "undefined". That just means that there is no telling how the browser will decide to handle it. It might decide to automatically close the `<p>` when it sees another close tag, or it could complain about an unexpected close tag at the header. Then it might complain again when there is a now unexpected close `</p>` tag.

If you played around with the minimal HTML file from the previous section, you might have noticed that you can get more minimal than that. For example, if you take out the "head" section completely, the browser will still render the page without complaint (at least Chrome will; Firefox does complain in the debugging console, but we will save that for week 4). In fact, you can even take out the "body" open and close tags (not the content, of course) and it will still work as expected. Not only that, if you take out the `<!doctype>` statement, it still works (and Chrome still doesn't complain!).

What's actually happening is that the browser knows roughly what to expect in an HTML page, so if it sees a file ending in '.html' it will automatically stick some stuff in if it is not there already. It will typically make basic assumptions like: It is an HTML5 file, everything in there is content, so it goes in the `<body>` section, the `<head>` section is empty.  If you right-click on an element and choose "Inspect", you will see that the browser has included the `<html>` section containing the `<head>` and `<body>` sections, even though it wasn't there in your file.

Note that we said "typically". The current behavior of most browsers will handle this, but it is "undefined" so there is no guarantee that next module's update won't break it.  To be correct and complete, you need the `<!doctype>` section and the `<html>` section with `<head>` and `<body>`. In any case, it is a good idea (best practice).

Proper indentation is one way to make your code clearer and easier to understand:

```html
<body>
<h1>Here is a heading</h1>
<p>
<ol><li>List Item 1</li></ol>
</p>
</body>
```

The code above doesn't give any sense of the structure of the document. By using indentation effectively, you can make it more clear, showing the nesting of elements:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Here is a heading</h1>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>List Item 1</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
</body>
```

Consistent quoting of strings is also helpful, in part to avoid potential problems that can arise when you think something does not need quotes but it actually does.

Often, projects will have coding styles that everyone is expected to use so that everything looks consistent and developers can more easily read each other's code. If you are creating the project, you can decide what the rules are (how many spaces to indent, single or double-quotes, etc.) but unless there is a good reason to change away from typical practices, it is usually best to adopt them.

### White space and other niceties

Before we go any further, it's good to understand a few technical details.  

#### Tags are case insensitive

You might notice that code is not always consistent in how a given tag is written.  We might say `<h1>` in one spot and `<H1>` in another.  In this case, they are exactly the same kind of tag.  Tag names are "case insensitive" meaning that it does not matter whether you use capital or lower case letters in writing them.  In fact, you could write your body tag as `<bOdY>`, but that's not generally considered a good practice (Camel case/Snake case makes it harder to read).  On the other hand, there are places where you want the computer to be "case sensitive", meaning the computer will distinguish between upper-case and lower-case.

Obviously, you usually don't want your text (that the user reads) to be case insensitive.  You want your sentences and proper names to start with capital letters, but most other characters to be lower-case (unless you want to yell, in which case use "all caps").  You generally don't want the browser to mess with that. You would probably be unhappy if the browser turned all your letters into lower case.  And people might think you're quite tightly wound if the browser converted everything to upper-case.

#### Don't worry about too many white spaces

On the other hand, we usually do not want to worry about the amount of white space (spaces, tabs and returns) in between words and lines and paragraphs (well sometimes we do, but there's a tag for that).  In HTML, most extra white space will be ignored.   By 'extra', I mean more than one space (or tab) consecutively.  There are many places where you need to be sure to separate one thing from another with a space, but it generally doesn't matter if you put more spaces in there, your result will look the same.  

Thus, all three of the following elements should look exactly the same when you read them in the browser:

```html
 <H1> This is the Beginning </H1>
 <H1>
    This is the Beginning
 </H1>
 <h1>This is the Beginning</h1>
```

It might seem confusing at first, but this rule about white space is actually very convenient.  The third option might be a bit too cramped for your taste, while the second might seem to take up too much room in your source code.  __Because it doesn't matter to the browser how much white space there is, you can use white space to make your code more visibly organized and easier to read (note the use of indentation in the second `<H1>` element above)__.

Given that tag names are case insensitive (you can write them either way), you might think that everything in between `<` and `>` is case insensitive, but it is not that easy.  

__Attributes are case sensitive!__ We have not learned much about attributes yet, but when we do we will discover that they are case sensitive, thus these two elements will have different 'id's:

```html
 <p id=ThisOne>
 <p id=thisone>
```

Even though they're spelled the same, the differing cases indicate different names.  Note that distinguishing different id's solely by case (i.e. spelled the same but with different capitalization) is a really bad practice (opposite of best practice).  Instead you can use capitalization in other ways, like [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

#### Any kind of quotes for strings

Finally, it will eventually be important to know about "strings".  Strings are just a series of characters.  They could be any characters like "Dingbats" or "ABC123^&*@aeiou".  They can even contain spaces as in "This is a string.".  Because they are so wildly variable (they can essentially be anything you can type), the computer needs us to indicate where a string begins and ends, which is typically done with quotation marks, either single (') or double ("). HTML tries to be helpful here.  

You will find that in places where HTML is expecting certain types of strings (say a string without spaces), even if you do not use the quotation marks it will essentially insert them for you. Thus:

```html
 <p id=MyName>
 <p id="MyName">
 <p id='MyName'>
```

.... are all equivalent.  

It is also important to know that, in HTML, __double and single quotes are almost interchangeable, but they have to match__.  If you start a string with a double quote, the computer will not end it until it sees another double quote.  Any single quotes will be happily considered part of the string, which is handy if you need quotation marks in your string.  Because of this, if you create a string as ' "quote" ' (single quotes containing a double quoted string),  your string will have the letters `<space>-"-q-u-o-t-e-"-<space>` (with double quotes in the string and spaces outside those) as opposed to "quote" which will just have the letters q-u-o-t-e (no quotation marks or spaces in the string).  Nevertheless, best practice is to be consistent in your quotes, so it's best to quote them all the same way, even if the browser would understand it anyway.

#### In summary:

The idea is to take advantage of these flexibilities to create clean organized code that is easy for a human to comprehend.  I guess you could sum it all up with these simple dictum:

+ __Case sensitive matters, except when it doesn't__ - case matters for some things, like strings and attributes, but not others, like tag names.
+ __White space is ignored, except when it's not__ - White space is used to separate things, but adding more than one space will be the same as just one.  White space in strings is always just as you type it.
+ __Quotation marks are not part of a string, except when they are__ - Quotation marks enclose a string, but thanks to the flexibility of choice between single or double quotes, it is easy to include one or the other in your string.
+ __The important thing is to look good__ - You can take advantage of flexibility in capitalization and white space to make your code more readable and organized.

#### Knowledge check 1.5.3

## 1.6 More on tags

### Tags we have already used

Now you can create a simple, empty, HTML page, and you know what tags are, though we have not said a lot about specific tags, what they mean, how many there are, etc.  We will start with the ones we have already seen:

+ `<!doctype>` - This tag is special.  In fact, many folks don't even consider it a tag, as it is officially the DTD - Document Type Declaration.  Unlike most tags, it has no closing tag, not even a "/" at the end.  It is there to declare exactly what type of HTML the computer will find in this file. It is used as that: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
+ `<html>` - The __html__ open and close tags wrap around nearly everything in your html file (except the doctype tag).  This essentially contains all of the HTML code in the file, which is generally everything (one big html element). In the next module, we will learn about attributes, and you will learn that you should always add a `lang` attribute to the html opening tag, to identify the default language of your page.
+ `<head>` - The __head__ element is where you put information that does not really appear in the body of the work.  For example, the `<title>` of the page, which typically appears on the window containing the page, is defined in the head section.
+ `<body>` - The __body__ section contains all of the content of your page, essentially what the user sees.  This could be text, pictures, links, videos, tables and so on.  In addition to the content, the body usually contains lots of other elements, each indicated by their own tags.
+ `<h1>` - There are a whole collection of 'h' tags, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` . . . all the way up to `<h6>`.  Why there are 6 rather than 5 or 7 may be a bit of a mystery, but there it is.  They're generally used the same way you would use chapter or section headings in a book (don't confuse the h here with the `<head>` section, that is completely different).  An `<h1>` tag might be used as the title of the document (as it appears on the page, not the same as the aforementioned `<title>` element), or to indicate the outermost level in a group of nested sections.

  Though you theoretically should not think about what it looks like, it will typically appear as large, possibly bold text in your document, to mark a separation or beginning of some new section.  `<h2>` is usually a bit smaller, and `<h3>` smaller yet and so on down to `<h6>`.  This allows logical nesting of sections, though they should not be nested too deeply. Try not to skip levels of headers when nesting them. __Headings are really useful for some assistive technology users and missing levels can be confusing.__

+ `<p>` - __P__ is for 'paragraph', which is how much of your text information might be arranged.  Depending on the style you are using, text wrapped in a `<p>` tag may be indented or have extra vertical white space before starting.  When rendered on the Web page, a `p` element will typically be a new line.

HTML Code in CodePen:

```html

<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
    
<body>
 <p>
This is a paragraph.
It may or may not be indented but it but there
should be a line break at the end.
Typically the last line will not stretch as far
to the right as the rest of the lines.
</p>
<p>
Often there is extra space between one paragraph and the next.
</p>
 
  
</body>

</html>
```

Result in Codepen:
> This is a paragraph. It may or may not be indented but it but there should be a line break at the end. Typically the last line will not stretch as far to the right as the rest of the lines.
>
> Often there is extra space between one paragraph and the next.

You might notice that when discussing how these different elements are rendered (i.e. what they look like to the end user), you will find words like "typically", "possibly", and "generally".  It is a little picky. As you will learn in Module 3, it is possible to change the styling of one element to look like just about any other element.  You could style a `<p>` element so that it looks like an `<h1>`, though best practice would be not to do that.


### A few new tags to learn

There are a lot more tags, but we will just cover a few more for now, mostly because they are straightforward to use and you can see the effect in your Web page when you use them:

+ `<q>` - The __q__ tag is for quotes.  This has no relationship to the somewhat confusing single and double quote characters, rather it's used when you want to quote a person or written work in your Web page.  It is customarily displayed using quotation marks, again unrelated to strings. Thus `<q>Brevity is beautiful</q>` would be rendered as `Brevity is beautiful`.
+ `<blockquote>` - If you want to quote a larger passage, you may want to use __blockquote__, which will typically set the quoted text apart from the surrounding text and indent it, to make clear that it is quoted text:

  > Early to bed and early to rise, makes someone healthy, wealthy and wise - Benjamin Franklin

+ `<ul>`, `<ol>` - These two tags are used to indicate a list of things.  The only difference is that `<ol>` is an "ordered" list, meaning the elements are in a particular order, and it might be a good idea to number them.  The "u" in `<ul>` stands for "unordered" and is used for a list of things where the order doesn't really matter, so it is usually rendered as a bulleted list, or something else without numbers.
+ `<li>` - The __li__ element is a "List Item", i.e. one item in the list.  As you might expect, this element only really makes sense nested inside a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`).  In the final rendering, each li element would typically be preceded by a number or bullet, or something similar (but not necessarily).  Thus a list in HTML would be look something like this:

  ```html
  <ul>
    <li> First item in list </li>
    <li> Second item in list </li>
    . . .
  </ul>
  ```

  This code might be rendered like this:
  + First item in list
  + Second item in list <br/>
    ...

There are a couple more tags we want to bring up at this point, but first a disclaimer.  We have been emphasizing the general rule that HTML is for the logical structure of your content, not what it looks like.  Well, nothing is perfect, including this goal.  There are some HTML elements that are primarily used to satisfy certain formatting requirements. 

+ `<hr>` - This one might be debatable.  __HR__ originally stood for "Horizontal Rule", i.e. a horizontal line across the width of the text.  It's still there in HTML5, but now is officially supposed to represent a "thematic break" in the content.  It would typically look like this: <hr>
+ `<br>` - This one signifies a line break.  It is used for any number of purposes.  For example it can be an easy way to make sure that lines of poetry break where they're supposed to (less verbose than requiring each line to be a separate element).  Essentially it helps break the "white space" rule: where spaces and carriage returns are generally treated the same, the `<br>` tag is treated as a _required carriage return_.  Because it's an empty tag (doesn't contain any text or anything, just indicates a particular point in the text), it doesn't really need a close tag, so it can be written as `<br>`, though `<br />` is also acceptable.  Oddly, in the browsers I tried, if you do add a close tag, as in `<br></br>`, the close tag is interpreted as a regular __br__ tag, thus you get two line breaks in a row.  One other thing to remember is that the `<br>` tag implies a break even if there is no break in the text containing it, i.e. these two sentences would be formatted exactly the same:

  ```html
  That which we call a rose <br>
  By any other name would smell as sweet
  
  That which we call a rose <br> By any other name
  would smell as sweet
  Example of poetry as it might appear on a Web page
  ```

  Shown as:
  > That which we call a rose <br>
  > By any other name would smell as sweet
  >
  >That which we call a rose <br> By any other name
  >would smell as sweet

+ `<pre>` - This is another tag that helps you break the white space rule.  __PRE__ stands for "PREformatted text", meaning "I've set this up just the way I want it, don't mess with it."  It generally implies a monospace font, and none of the spaces, tabs or carriage-returns are ignored.  It is very handy for illustrating bits of program code, or other "typewritten" material:

  ```html
    <pre>
        <h1>Page Heading</h1>
        <p>And here is the first paragraph</p>
    </pre>
  ```

</a>

### Activity - Your first Web page

For your first Web page, we propose that you:

+ Quote some poetry, preserving the "line oriented" format
+ Find a word that has at least 3 different definitions, list them in any order ([this Web site](http://englishwithatwist.com/2014/03/18/10-english-words-with-the-most-multiple-meanings-part-1/) may be helpful)
+ Try out some different tags to see the effect they have on your Web page

### Recipe project - Module 1

Throughout the course, we'll be building a simple project, adding to it with what we've learned in each module. This project will be a simple Web application that will allow you to browse different recipes.

For now, we'll start off with a simple first draft using just what we've learned about HTML5 using tags we've covered.  We want to have the following components:

+ A large title for the app, something like "My Favorite Recipes", or whatever you'd like to call it.
+ A description of a recipe, just some plain text explaining what the recipe is and any other pertinent information.
+ A set of steps to follow, numbered in order.

Please start with this "empty page" in CopePen:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>My favorite Recipes</title>
</head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
```

... and write the correct markup in order to get this result:

[My Code](./prjs/2.5-Recipes.html)

If you want to share an actual work/recipe in the discussion forum, please either copy-paste your lines of code into a JSBin or a CodePen project, or write your HTML5 code directly into one of these online tools.
