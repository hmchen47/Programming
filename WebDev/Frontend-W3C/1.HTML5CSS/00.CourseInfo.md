## Course tools 

### Web editors

The first computer programs were actually [configurations of connections between circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programming). A programmer would design the setup, then a host of people would reconfigure patch cords and the like to realize the program. The next step was flipping bits to write machine code directly to the computer memory. Fortunately, we won't be going back that far in creating source for Web apps.

The next step in programming history was made using very basic text editors. Text could be edited one line at a time, and there was no concept of GUI ([Graphics User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)). Now, it turns out, that is enough to create a Web page, as its source is simply text. But that would be painfully tedious.  Stepping up, we finally had text editors that were more visually oriented, in fact one early example was called "[Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi)" (previously known as Vi - for "Visual").

Simple visual editors are quite capable; in fact a great deal of the Web was built using [visual editors of one sort or another](http://xkcd.com/378/) ([xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) webcomic strip entitled "Real Programmers"). Thus if you're familiar with Notepad or TextEdit or even Vim, you can produce a Web page. Of course, innovation didn't stop there and visual editors have incrementally improved to help you write code in particular languages or detect errors, etc.

One caveat: you need to make sure that whatever editor you choose will save to a "plain text" format ('.txt'). Some editors will save to other formats by default (".rtf", ".doc", etc.) so you need to make sure you save your source code as plain text.

All that is to say that there are lots of options when it comes to creating Web pages. There are, of course, GUI drag-and-drop solutions, where you can create a Web page as you would a diagram or picture, but we want to learn the nitty-gritty details of HTML, so we'll ignore those options.

A non-exhaustive list
Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:

+ [Notepad](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - on Windows PC's
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
+ [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
+ TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're saving as [plain text](https://discussions.apple.com/message/5014514#5014514), not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
+ [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
+ [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) - another cross platform editor, created by [GitHub](https://github.com/).
+ [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - great editors on which the Internet was built, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.

Knowledge check (not graded) <br/>
If your editor saves in a variety of formats, which of the following should you be sure to use for your Web page?

    a. .exe or Executable
    b. .rtf or Rich Text Format
    c. .txt or plain text
    d. .docx or MS Document File

    Ans: c

### Online editors

To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, you will use the following tools. Pretty much all the course's examples will actually use these tools.

+ JS Bin (https://jsbin.com/) <br/>
    JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Some examples you will find in this course are on JS Bin.

    Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as this [one](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-tools-of-the-trade-jsbin--net-36843) or that [other one](https://jsbin.com/help/getting-started/)) or on YouTube ([video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTooRDWOrIu23P3SEZ3luIUq)). The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.

+ CodePen (https://codepen.io/) <br/>
    CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming and teaching. We are providing a short live coding video on how to use CodePen at the beginning of Module 1

    Here's an article which will be of-interest if you use CodePen: [10 Cool Things You Can Do with CodePen and JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/cool-things-codepen-javascript/), Chris Coyier, June 13, 2016.

There are many other handy tools such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) (Lea Verou's tool). Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc. Sharing them using JSBin, or similar tools, would be really appreciated.


### W3C validators

W3C Developers home pageFor over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting [free](http://w3c.github.io/developers/) and [open source tools](http://w3c.github.io/developers/) used every day by millions of Web developers and Web designers. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the [W3C Developers tools](http://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/) site.

+ W3C Validator <br/>
    The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks the [markup validity](http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics) of various Web document formats, such as HTML. Note that you are automatically directed to the [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) when validating an HTML5 document.

+ CSS Validator <br/>
    The [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.

+ Unicorn <br/>
    [Unicorn](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/) is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.

+ Internationalization Checker <br/>
    The [W3C Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of  issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.

+ Link Checker <br/>
    The [W3C Link Checker](http://validator.w3.org/checklink) looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid [(X)HTML Markup](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


### The W3C cheatsheet

The [W3C cheatsheet](http://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/) provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.

Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.

The W3C cheatsheet is no longer available as an Android app, but remains available as a [pure Web application](http://dev.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/doc/).


## About W3C and the Web

### What is W3C?

As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.
W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.

A few history bits

[Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) wrote a [proposal](http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then created the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in collaboration with [CERN](http://www.cern.ch/), where the Web originated (see information on the [original CERN Server](http://www.w3.org/Daemon/)), with support from DARPA and the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm).

In April 1995, [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/) became the first European W3C host, followed by [Keio University of Japan](http://www.keio.ac.jp/) (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, [ERCIM](http://www.ercim.org/) took over the role of European W3C Host from Inria. In 2013, W3C announced [Beihang University](http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) as the fourth Host.

In addition to these four Host locations that employ W3C staff, there are [W3C Offices](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/staff) around the globe that support the developer communities in their regions and organize local events. Find the one next to your place!

#### A few figures

As of July 2018, W3C is:

+ A [member](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List)-driven organization composed of over 473 companies, universities, start-ups, etc. from all over the world.
+ 46 [technical groups](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities), including Working and Interest Groups where technical specifications are discussed and developed.
+ Over 6,348 [published technical reports](http://www.w3.org/TR/), including 407 Web standards (or W3C Recommendations) - since January 1st ,1995.
+ About 309 [Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/), where developers, designers, and anyone passionate about the Web have a place to hold discussions and publish ideas.
+ Near 11,756 active participants constituting the W3C community.
+ A [technical staff](http://www.w3.org/People/) composed of 62 people, spread on all five continents.


#### Sir Tim Berners-Lee named recipient of the ACM A.M. Turing Award

On Tuesday 4 April 2017, the ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, named Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as the recipient of the 2016 [ACM A.M. Turing Award](http://amturing.acm.org/). The Turing award is recognized as the highest distinction in Computer Science and is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing”.

Sir Tim is being given this award for inventing the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Web is considered one of the most influential computing innovations in history.

### The Web is amazing!

People often use the words "Internet" and "Web" interchangeably, but this usage is technically incorrect.

The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) and [ftp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) for example. One analogy equates the Internet to a road network where the Web is a car, the email is a bicycle, etc.  Read [this article](https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-the-internet-and-the-web-2483335) for more details about the difference between Internet and the Web.

The W3C community is passionate about creating free and open Web standards. The next video, created in partnership with Microsoft, explains why standards are important to maintain a royalty-free, Open Web Platform, as well as to help shape the Web of the future.

## Why accessibility is important

### What is Web accessibility?

> The power of the Web is in its universality. <br/>
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. <br/>
> __Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web__

The Web has become an essential aspect of our daily lives, and everyone should have access to this technology. Web accessibility focuses on ensuring equivalent access for people with disabilities. It is increasingly important to many organizations and governments from around the world, and has many business benefits. Access to information, including on the Web, is also recognized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

#### Who is impacted?

Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing, learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:

+ _Captions_ on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of hearing;
+ _Clear and consistent layout_ for people with learning and cognitive disabilities;
+ _Keyboard support_ for people with physical disabilities and who do not use a mouse;
+ _Text alternatives_ for people with visual disabilities and who are using screen readers;

#### Web accessibility benefits people with and _without_ disabilities

Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:

+ People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
+ People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
+ People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
+ People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own Web site;
+ People who are not fluent in the language of your particular Web site;

The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. More information is available in the [W3C Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) overview.

</a>


### First steps in Web accessibility

There are many simple Web accessibility improvements that you can implement and check right away, even when you are new to this topic. Two example excerpts are provided below on this page but you can find more tips and information from W3C/WAI:

+ [Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/)
+ [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary)

#### Example 1: Page title

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the Web page markup, they are the words `<title>` within the `<head>`.

__Check #1: There is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of a page, and it distinguishes the page from other Web pages.__

Example:
```html
<head>
...
<title>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page</title>
...
</head>
```

#### Example 2: Image text alternatives ("alt text")

Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.

__Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.__

Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.

```html
<a href="https://w3.org">
<img src="https://w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png" width="72" height="48" alt="World Wide Web Consortium">
</a>
```


## Why internationalization is important

### What is internationalization?

Access to the Web for all has been a fundamental concern and goal of the W3C since the beginning. It is easy to overlook the needs of people from cultures different to your own, or who use different languages or writing systems, but you have to ensure that any content or application that you design or develop is ready to support the international features that they will need.

'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' and the 'n'.

The [W3C Internationalization Activity](https://www.w3.org/International/) works with W3C working groups and liaises with other organizations to make it possible to use Web technologies with different languages, scripts, and cultures.

During this course you will learn about some basic internationalisation features, such as character encoding and language declarations. If you don't use those features you will create barriers for people from different cultures who are trying to access your content. This is important even if you think you are only designing for a specific community – communities are made up of diverse individuals, and the Web stretches worldwide.

### Unicode

Text in a computer or on the Web is composed of characters. _Characters_ represent letters of the alphabet, punctuation, or other symbols.

Unicode is a universal character set, ie. a standard that defines, in one place, all the characters needed for writing languages in use on computers. It is a superset of all other character sets that have been encoded.

As a content author or developer, you should nowadays always [choose the UTF-8 character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings) for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single encoding to handle any character you are likely to meet. This greatly simplifies things.


### First steps in Web internationalization

You find below three examples (and checks!) to help you to ensure that your Web page works for people around the world, and to make it work differently for different cultures, where needed. Let's meet the words 'charset' and 'lang', soon to become your favorite markup ;)

#### Example 1: Character encoding declaration

A character encoding declaration is _vital to ensure that the text in your page is recognized by browsers around the world_, and not garbled. You will learn more about what this is, and how to use it as you work through the course.  For now, just ensure that it's always there.

__Check #1: There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and its value is UTF-8.__

Example 1:
```html
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>
```

#### Example 2: Primary language declaration

For a wide variety of reasons, it's important for a browser to know what language your page is written in, including font selection, text-to-speech conversion, spell-checking, hyphenation and automated line breaking, text transforms, automated translation, and more. _You should always indicate the primary language of your page in the `<html>` tag_. Again you will learn how to do this during the course.  You will also learn how to change the language, where necessary, for parts of your document that are in a different language.

__Check #2: The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.__

Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
...
```

#### Example 3: Cultural bias

People around the world don't always understand cultural references that you are familiar with, for example the concept of a 'home run' in baseball, or a particular type of food. You should be careful when using examples to illustrate ideas. Also, people in other cultures don't necessarily identify with pictures that you would recognize, for example, hand gestures can have quite unexpected meanings in other parts of the world, and photos of people in a group may not be representative of populations elsewhere.  When creating forms for capturing personal details, you will quickly find that your assumptions about how personal names and addresses work are very different from those of people from other cultures.

__Check #3: If your content will be seen by people from diverse cultures, check that your cultural references will be recognized and that there is no inappropriate cultural bias.__

#### Don't worry!

You will learn about the basics as you progress through the course, so don't worry about things you don't understand on this page – you'll learn about them shortly. Once you have taken the course, you can find more tips and information from the W3C at: [Internationalization techniques: Authoring HTML & CSS](https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html?collapse).

When you start creating Web pages, you can also run them through the W3C's [Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/).  If there are internationalization problems with your page, this checker explains what they are and what to do about it.
