    <h1>Birds and Not Birds</h1>
    <h2>A compendium of flying and not flying things</h2>
    <p>While walking through the woods with my daughter she asked me <q>Papa, what kind of bird is that?</q> and was pointing to an <a href="#ok">oesterkirche</a>. (A huge one!)</p>
    <p>I told her its name and explained that while an oesterkirche flies like a bird and eats bugs and worms (<sup><a href="#footnote">*</a></sup>) like a bird, it is not, in fact, a bird. This lead us to a discussion of other flying things that might or might not be birds, and birds that don't fly. Here is our list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="bird">penguin</li>
        <li class="bird flying">hawk</li>
        <li class="flying">oesterkirche</li>
        <li class="insect flying">butterfly</li>
        <li class="bird">ostrich</li>
        <li class="insect flying">wasp</li>
        <li class="bird flying">sparrow</li>
        <li class="insect">ant</li>
        </ul>
