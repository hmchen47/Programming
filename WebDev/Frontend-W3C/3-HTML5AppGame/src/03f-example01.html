  This example proposes only one single JavaScript function for:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating a Database, for storing customers (a customer has a social security number (property "ssn"), a name, an age and an email)</li>
    <li>Creating an object store in that dataBase,</li>
    <li>Specifying a keyPath (a property in the objects stored that will act as a Primary Key, in our case the social security number),</li>
    <li>Adding two indexes for faster retrievals (one on the name, on on the email property of each object),</li>
    <li>Populating the dataBase with three entries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Press the following button for calling the createDatabase() JavaScript function. Then look at the debugging console (with Chrome: F12 + Resources tab)</p>
  <button onclick="createDatabase();">Create CustomerDB database</button>
