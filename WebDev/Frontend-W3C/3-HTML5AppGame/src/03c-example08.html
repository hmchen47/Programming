    <p id="text"><b>Drag and drop a text selection from this paragraph</b>. Drag and drop any part of this text to the drop zone. Notice in the code: there is no need for a dragstart handler in case of text selection: the text is added to the clipboard when dragged with a key/name equal to "text/plain". Just write a drop handler that will do an event.dataTransfert.getData("text/plain") and you are done!</p>
  
    <p class="notDraggable">This paragraph is not selectable, however. Look at the CSS in the source code.</p>

    <div class="box" ondragover="return false" ondrop="drop(this, event)">
    <p>Drop some text selection here.</p>
