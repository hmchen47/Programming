               <p>
                   This is a simple animation that plays an arbitrary 
                   animal sound when the square hits the canvas's border. To play different sounds
                   i used the addTextTrack method to add a textTrack, then used the VTTCue 
                   class to create cues and added the cues to the textTrack that i added to the audio.(view the js code to see how it all works!)
               </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Note: Since the autoplay policy has changed you have to interact with your browser window as least once eg. by clicking a mouse button, if you want to hear the sound(s).
                    </b>
                  <br/>
                    Thus far this code doesn't work on microsoft edge (the VTTCue constructor is not supported). Use one of the other major browsers to see it in action.
