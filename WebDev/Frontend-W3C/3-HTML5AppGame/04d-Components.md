## 4.4 The Orientation and Device Motion APIs


### 4.4.1 The Orientation API

This section covers the [HTML5 orientation API](https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-orientation/): a way to use angle measures provided by accelerometers from mobile devices or laptops such as MacBooks.

__Beware__: all examples must be run on a device with an orientation sensor and/or with an accelerometer. Furthermore, Chrome/Safari and Mozilla support this API, but Opera mobile doesn't (yet) at the time of writing. 

If it provides a "mobile device emulation mode", you can use the devtools of a desktop browser to fake the orientation values (see the support table below, the columns for desktop versions of browsers are about the support for this emulation mode).
