## Course practical information

### Getting around the course

<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started. Even if you've used edX for other courses, the information here will help orient you to how this course is laid out.</div>

#### Layout of the course

The CSS Basics course is composed of 5 weeks/modules, covering 5 topics. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you'll need to learn for the module's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit will generally have some video content, reading material and sometimes an activity. The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the assessments and the exercises that you will find at the end of each module, you should learn the material in all the units.

#### Bookmarks

It is now possible to bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the [related documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_bookmarks.html).

  </a></div>
</div>

#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds.

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and __they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate__. Read [this documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators) to find more.

Note that past learners were sometimes experiencing a bug where pages that included a discussion component were not listed as completed on the course outline. This bug has since been fixed, but if you notice another specific unit that is giving trouble, please review the [progress indicator documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators), and if you are still having trouble, please send a link to the specific unit to our learner support team at info@edx.org so that we can check if anything is amiss.

#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the __discussion boards (or forums)__. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and `Ctrl+K`/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com ([JS Bin tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-tools-of-the-trade-jsbin--net-36843))
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io ([CodePen tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/))

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.

#### Other resources

+ [edX Learners' Guide](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/index.html): The guide answers common questions about topics like getting started in an online course, earning certificates, participating in course discussions, etc.
+ [edX Student FAQ](https://www.edx.org/about/student-faq): This FAQ answers a lot of questions about the edX student experience. You should at least read over the questions so if you encounter any issues during the course, you can refer back to this document for help.


### Course forums

This course will provide discussion forums. Forums will be available at the end of most course subsections, so you create posts on the topic being discussed in a particular subsection. You are free to use the forums to connect with other students and the instructor, as well as ask questions about the material. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post as either a question or a discussion. When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question or a discussion.

In addition, students will have a varied level of experience with the technologies covered in this course, so questions will range from the very basic to the very advanced. You are encouraged to assist other students and share your experiences with the product. Thanks a lot!

_edX is a global platform: as such, when creating posts, please be respectful of all cultures, creeds and religions._


### Forum guidelines and best practices

Below are guidelines and best practices for productive collaboration and discussion in our course.

+ __Participate!__ It will enhance your learning experience and some discussions may be subject to examination.
+ __Help each other!__ We encourage you to reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
+ __Be polite!__ Opinions are good, but please respect others’ opinions as well.
+ __Do not cheat!__ See collaboration guidelines below to see what’s acceptable.

#### Collaboration Guidelines

These will help you use the forum appropriately as an aid to learning the material. We encourage you to:

+ Discuss the general approach to solving a problem.
+ Share your work results (following proposed activities or other).
+ Work jointly to come up with the steps for a solution, or to create an original work.
+ Ask for a hint or clarification in the discussion board, or several hints for that matter, if you get stuck while solving a problem.
+ Please search (use the search button) for an answer to your question in the discussion board before posting. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions and you may find the question and answer without needing to post it yourself.

It is NOT ok to:

+ Post the solution to a problem in the discussion board or somewhere else on the Web. If you need help, post errors you’re encountering, but not your answers.
+ Take someone else's solution and simply copy the answers from their solution.

These actions are considered to be cheating. Violations of these guidelines may result in posts being deleted or your account being deactivated.

#### Guidelines to navigate and interact on the forum

The discussion forum helps improve your ability to search and talk about many different topics throughout the course. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ At the end of some pages, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Use a descriptive and specific title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners having the same issue.
+ Use “netiquette,” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
    + Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
    + Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).
    + Avoid repeating letters or characters like this: reeepeeaattingggg chaaracterrrss
    + Avoid excessive punctuation if possible (e.g. !!!!!!!! or ??????)

It’s fine to make suggestions, but avoid negative commentary and please do not “flame” anyone.


### A bug to report?

In case you find a broken link or a typo or any other factual problem related to the content material, we would appreciate if you could report it in the discussion forum below. We will do our best to check this forum on a regular basis, and provide a solution. Thank you.


## Course tools

### Web browsers

Not surprisingly, it would be helpful to have a browser installed so that you can see the end product of your source code: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge).

For my demos, I will be using the Edge Web browser. You can view your work in these Web browsers, even if you haven't uploaded your code to the internet. Simply put the local address of an html file into your chosen Web browser's address bar and it should be able to open it so you can view your work.
