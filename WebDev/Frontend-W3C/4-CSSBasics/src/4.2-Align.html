      Here is a big block of text illustrating the usage of the text-align justify setting. As you can see it stretches the white space between the words so that the left and right edges of the paragraph fit well within a box. This can help your text look cleaner than a simple left alignment. Note that it does not stretch out the final line in the paragraph.

    <h3>this header's line height is stretched to 1.2</h3>
    <h4>this header is aligned to the baseline of the line height within a stretched containing box</h4>
