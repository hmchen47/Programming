  <h1>H.-M. Fred Chen</h1>
  <h2>"Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries." <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  â€” Samuel Johnson (Boswell's Life of Johnson)</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Fred Chen.  I enjoy reading fantasy novels, swimming, playing golf and tennis. In addition, I love traveling.  I have been many countries, including England, Scotland, Germany, Netherland, Italy, Greek.  After moving to North American, I have been many states of the US and provinces of Canada. Last trip my wife and I went to Las Vegas.   Next trip I will travel to Cororado.  So exciting.</p>
