## Welcome to "HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices"

This course is a natural follow up of the [CSS Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/css-basics) and [HTML5&CSS Fundamentals courses](https://tinyurl.com/ya7nwutt). As such, required prerequisites are:

+ Be comfortable putting together an HTML document,
+ Have minimal familiarity with CSS,
+ Basic knowledge of JavaScript and DOM APis is sufficient, and this course will include a recap of basics. You are also more than welcome to follow the [JavaScript Introduction](https://tinyurl.com/ydhjes5x) course (introductory level).

During this course, you will learn:

+ Learn the simplified HTML5 tags, and how to use microdata
+ Play with the audio and video tags
+ Use the Webcam
+ Draw and animate fun Web graphics
+ Discover HTML5 form features
+ Test the basic APIs, such as Web storage and geolocation
+ And most of all, practice coding techniques thanks to multiple interactive examples

The HTML5 course team is thrilled to guide you in your learning experience. We are committed to teach you how to code Web pages, and how to do it the correct way. We encourage you to create Web pages and apps and share them in the discussion forums. Have fun!

### Getting around the course

If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started.

You are also welcome to register to DemoX, which is a fun and interactive edX course designed to help you explore the edX learning experience.


#### Layout of the course

This course is composed of 6 weeks/modules. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you need to learn for the module 's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit generally has some video content, reading material, an activity, and one or two questions to test your knowledge. Those questions are called "knowledge checks". The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the exercises (and the final exam!) that is the end of each module, you should learn the material in all the units.


#### Bookmarks

You can bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the related documentation.


#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds.

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate. Read this documentation to find more.


#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the discussion boards (or forums). This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: https://jsbin.com ([JS Bin tutorial](https://tinyurl.com/yxrpoqek))
+ CodePen: https://codepen.io ([CodePen tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/))

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactive online code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.
