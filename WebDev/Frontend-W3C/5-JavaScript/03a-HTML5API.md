### 3.1.2 Module 3 outline

What you will learn in Module 3:

Note that this module is more "project oriented", meaning less fundamental concepts are presented.

+ JavaScript arrays and strings: let's study fundamental JavaScript concepts, and this time let's have a closer look to JavaScript arrays and strings.
+ New HTML5 APIs: we've already seen the selector and the DOM APIs, respectively for selecting and manipulating HTML elements dynamically. We also had a taste of the HTML5 canvas API for drawing and animating. This time, let's look at the audio and video elements APIs, as well as the geolocation API.
+ Finally, let's add background music and sound effects to the small game we started writing during module 2.
