# Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript

## 1.4 Your first HTML/CSS/JS page

#### 1.4.1 Creating an HTML/CSS/JS project

Let's create a small HTML/CSS/JS project together.

It's time for you (and me) to create a small HTML/CSS/JS project, step by step, following some best practices. We will do this using different tools: source code editors + files but also two online IDEs (JsBin.com and CodePen.io). We will see how to write/debug the code and also how to migrate a project prototyped with online tools to a project you can run and edit on your hard drive using regular source code editors.

Many things we use in this example may be new to you. Don't worry. We will cover them either later on this week or over the following weeks. It's time to throw you in the deep end of the JavaScript world, getting you to write code, and look at examples etc. And from time to time, we will take a break and have a "real", "academic", look at the concepts of the language you have been using. We think this is the best way for you to learn!

#### Topic

We will write a small, interactive HTML page that will use some HTML input fields for indicating the name of a math function we'd like to plot, the ranges for the x and y values, the color of the curve etc.

We will first write this application online, using the JsBin.com editor, then we will do the same thing using the CodePen online editor, then, using a regular source code editor and .html, .css and .js files.

__Here is what the resulting Web page will look like:__
