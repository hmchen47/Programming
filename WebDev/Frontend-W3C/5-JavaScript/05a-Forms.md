### 5.1.2 Module 5 outline

What you will learn in Module 5:

+ __We continue the study of object-oriented JavaScript programming with "predefined classes":__ Object, Array, String, Date, Math
+ __We present a very useful API for building HTML5 tables dynamically.__
+ __We'll also see how to use HTML5 forms from JavaScript:__ intercept their submission, retrieve input field values, and so on.
+ __We will study the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format__, used extensively when manipulating data from remote servers (via REST WebServices) or for persistence (saving data client or server-side). We will see several examples that consume such data and display them in a dynamic HTML5 table.
+ __Finally, we will develop together a mini contact manager__ using classes, a dynamic table, a form and load/save its data using the JSON format. It will be your job to improve it by adding additional features.

This module ends with the final exam which regroups questions specific to the current module but also a potpourri of questions related to the 4 previous modules.
