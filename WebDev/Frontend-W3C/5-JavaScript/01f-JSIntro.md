# Module 1: Introduction to JavaScript

## 1.6 Simple JavaScript examples to play with

### 1.6.1 Introduction

This section does not detail the examples presented. Some of them are studied later in the course, some won't.

The examples are just here to bring some fun whilst making you play with some various uses of JavaScript. You are invited to look at their source code, and to tweak the examples. Do not worry if you don't understand how they work. We are just giving you "a taste" of JavaScript. There will be no graded exercises about them.
