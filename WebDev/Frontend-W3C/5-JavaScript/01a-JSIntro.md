### 1.1.2 Module 1 outline

If you thought that a Web browser could only display HTML documents, you were mistaken!  ;)

Under the hood, an HTML document is nearly always associated with two other standard languages of the Web: CSS and JavaScript. Before looking at the guts of JavaScript, we introduce the basics and play with many examples. We will also have a first look at the browser devtools, and discover how JavaScript is useful.

+ First, let's briefly discuss the roles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and how they work together.
+ We show examples of what can be done with JavaScript: a showcase of very small examples through to impressively complex ones.
+ Then we look at a dozen different - very small - examples of typical uses of JavaScript.
+ Finally, we learn how to use the browser devtools, a powerful, built-in set of tools that represent the Swiss army knife of any Web developer. Without the devtools, you would not be able to debug your code, find errors, print traces of what a JavaScript program is doing etc.

__A word of caution:__ you will not learn JavaScript in full detail in this course! This is an introductory course designed to help you understand the basic concepts of the language.
