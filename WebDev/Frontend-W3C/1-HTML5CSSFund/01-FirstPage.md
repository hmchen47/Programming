## 1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

### Vague but exciting!

Twenty eight years ago today, a proposal was sent internally at CERN outlying a universal linked information system. Dubbed 'Information Management: A proposal', pictured below, the proposal was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall, who described it as 'vague but exciting'.

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;flex-flow:row wrap;">
  <div><a href="url">
    <img src="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/Image1.gif" style="margin: 0.1em;" alt="Tim Berners-Lee original proposal for the Web" title="Tim Berners-Lee original proposal for the Web" width="350">
  </a></div>
</div>

Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for universality enabled the development of a high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any other documents.

The World Wide Web was initially created to make it easier to share research papers. It is a system of interlinked ‘hypertext’ documents that are accessed via the Internet; in essence, an information space. While he did not invent hypertext systems, Berners-Lee proposed using them 'to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.'

His breakthrough was to link hypertext to the Internet and he used three technologies to do this:

+ HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the Web.
+ HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main mark-up language for creating Web pages and information that can be displayed on a Web browser.

Web addresses or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are used to reference a Web page.
In the following pages, we present HTML through what is usually called the big 3 (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript), the hypertext concept and the browser, an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.


### HTML5, CSS and JS

#### What is HTML5?

When people say 'HTML5', they usually mean a bit more than just the 5th version of the "HyperText Markup Language". Modern Web pages and Web applications are generally composed of at least three components, so what people often mean when they say 'HTML5' is the trio of languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc. 

While there have been numerous versions of HTML since its inception, our focus in this course is the most recent version, HTML5. HTML5 was developed to provide more powerful and flexible ways for developers to create dynamic Web pages.


#### CSS

The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content. We'll be going into more detail on that later in this course, but for now, think of it as the way you might specify a "theme" in a word processing document, setting fonts, sizes, indentations and whatever else may apply to what it looks like.


#@### JavaScript

The 'JavaScript', or 'JS' for short, part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application, with nearly unlimited possibilities.  We will not be doing much with JavaScript in this course, but you should know that it is an important leg of the stool for modern Web pages.


### Hypertext

A fundamental key to the World Wide Web is the concept of "Hypertext".  Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together, not unlike using footnotes, except much easier and more flexible. The idea was to "Mark Up" your document with links and define how to break it down into different segments (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.)

That's why, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee began to create a definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate Hyperlinks in a text document.

  </a></div>
</div>

He envisioned a technology that would facilitate thoroughly interconnected documents. He wanted authors to be able to connect an idea in one document to the source of the idea in another, or connect a statement with the data that backs up that statement. Traditionally, this kind of thing was done with footnotes and bibliographies, which can be cumbersome. This information should be easily transferable from one place to another, so that in reading one document, it is easy to access everything related (linked) to it. Tim Berners-Lee imagined a "Web" of interconnected documents.

He used the metaphor of a Web to emphasize the importance of connections between documents. It was not just a long list of details, but rather a sea of information stretching out in all directions. This sea of information was navigated by a new tool called a "Browser".


#### Knowledge check 1.2.3

True or False: The primary purpose of HTML is to assist formatting of text.

  Ans: False, xTrue<br/>
  Explication: Though there are a few HTML tags used for formatting, HTML is primarily designed to help organize a document semantically. CSS is used for formatting and other aspects of design.


### The browser

The Internet existed long before the Web came to fruition, and lots of organizations were connected to it, including schools, companies and government organizations.  As things progressed through the 80's, the Internet was used for file transfers, newsgroups (a kind of open forum), email and other conveniences.

At the time there were a number of different programs like '[fetch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(FTP_client))', ['gopher'](http://www.yourdictionary.com/gopher#Noun-3)' and '[archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine)' that were used to download, browse and search for files.  Typically, you might use one tool to search for the location of files of interest, then another to copy that file to a local machine.  Then, you still needed more tools to read that file.  If it was text, you could use a text editor, if it was a formatted document you might need a word processor, if a picture you would need an image viewer and so on.

[Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) conceived of a solution that would put all the pieces together in one app, making it easy for users to browse all the different sorts of information and data on the World Wide Web.  Together with others, he started the "Mosaic" project.

Though not technically the first browser, Mosaic was the first one that many people experienced and played a big part in popularizing the concept of the World Wide Web and the Web browser. It provided a simple graphical way to access and browse the various resources on the Internet. Instead of using different tools to download and view information on the Internet, a simple click on a link would present the information in a graphical window. In many ways, it is the ancestor of most modern browsers.


### Activity - Explore the Web

Exploring the Web, "Then and Now":

+ Go to archive.org and find the earliest instance of the Web site: www.google.com.
+ Note the differences between that and its current Web site.
+ Find an old news story, see how far back you can go (hint: start by looking at yahoo.com).
+ In general, what differences do you notice between Web sites from the 90's and Web sites today?
+ Post your observations and findings in the discussion forum below.


## 1.3 Elements, tags and attributes

### Putting the "M" in HTML

So the "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean? Essentially, it means to annotate a document with extra information. Things like where different sections and paragraphs begin and end, which part is the title, which things should be emphasized and so on.  

There are many ways to markup a document, but HTML borrows a technique from an ancestor language, SGML ([Standard Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language)), which uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") to separate the annotations from the regular text.  In HTML these annotations are called "tags".

For example, consider the following chunk of HTML code:

```html
   <body>
    <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
    <p>
      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . .
    </p>
    . . .
    <p>
      . . . it is a far, far better rest
      that I go to than I have ever known.
    </p>
  </body>
```

If you eliminated everything in between the angle brackets from the text, for most purposes it would still read the same:

<pre style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;"><code>A Tale of Two Cities</code><br>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . .<br>  . . .<br>. . . it is a far, far better rest<br>    that I go to than I have ever known.</pre>

Once you know that everything in angle brackets is "meta-information", it leaves a lot of flexibility. You can put a lot of different things in between those brackets without any of it showing up (directly) in your finished document. And, though you don't usually see directly what's in those angle brackets, they can often have a big effect on what your Web page looks like as well as how it responds and interacts with you.


#### Try It Out!

I expect at this point you may be longing to write some HTML code.  As is the tradition in programming tutorials, we'll pause here to create a simple "Hello HTML" program. Please choose any Web editor of your liking (see in the subsection "Course tools" - Module 0).

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget). But it's better to use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.


### Programming "Hello HTML"

You can build and edit your HTML pages by either using online editors or editors that you can install on your machine like Visual Studio Code.


#### Using online editors:

Both [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) are two online editors that you can use to create HTML Web pages. The following two videos show you how to create your first HTML page using [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

### Elements

If you are sitting at a coffee shop next to a table of Web developers, you will probably hear three words quite a bit:  'Tags', 'Attributes' and 'Elements' (or sometimes 'DOM elements', same thing just more precise and wordy).

'Elements' are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element.  Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header elements, paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the DOM.

<svg width="600" height="300"><g transform="translate(120,20)"><g class="node" transform="translate(0,130)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">html</text></g></g></svg>

Consider the figure above.  It contains a single 'html' element.  It turns out this includes within it the entire content of your html file.  If you click on the "html" node, you'll find that it contains two components, a head and a body.  Clicking on each of those will reveal their respective contents.  This structure is what we computer scientists call a "tree".  Any given element (except for the outermost 'html' element) is wholly contained inside another element, referred to as the "parent" element.  Not surprisingly, the elements that a given element contains are its "child" elements.  And, yes, children of a common parent are often referred to as "siblings".

Thus in the example above, the top element is the html element, which contains just two elements, the head and body.  The head element contains a title element and the body contains an 'h1' element and a 'p' element.  In a more typical example, the body would contain many more children, but for our purpose this is enough.

That may be a great picture, but how do we represent such a structure in a text file?  Well, that's where "tags" come in.


### Tags

'Tags' are what we use to organize a text file (which is just a long string of characters) such that it represents a tree of elements that make up the html document.  Tags are not the elements themselves, rather they're the bits of text you use to tell the computer where an element begins and ends.  When you 'mark up' a document, you generally don't want those extra notes that are not really part of the text to be presented to the reader. HTML borrows a technique from another language, SGML, to provide an easy way for a computer to determine which parts are "MarkUp" and which parts are the content. By using '<' and '>' as a kind of parentheses, HTML can indicate the beginning and end of a tag, i.e. the presence of '<' tells the browser 'this next bit is markup, pay attention'.

Whatever that tag (or 'open tag') does, it applies to the content following the tag. Unless you want that to be the entire rest of the document, you need to indicate when to stop using that tag and do something else, so '<' and '>' are again used. Since elements are typically nested within other elements, the browser needs to be able to distinguish between the end of the current tag or the beginning of a new tag (representing a nested element). This is done by adding a '/' right after the '<' to indicated that it's a 'close tag'. To indicate the beginning and end of a paragraph (indicated by the single letter 'p') you end up with something like this:

```html
<p>This is my first paragraph!</p>
```

The browser sees the letters `<p>` and decides 'A new paragraph is starting, I'd better start a new line and maybe indent it'. Then when it sees `</p>` it knows that the paragraph it was working on is finished, so it should break the line there before going on to whatever is next.

For example, the `<em>` tag is used for element that needs Emphasis.  The  '<' and '>' indicate that this is a tag, and the "little bits of text" in between tell us what kind of tag it is.  To completely describe the element, it needs an open and close tag, with everything in between the tags is the contents of the element:

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;flex-flow:row wrap;">
  <div><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2019/courseware/633117d2ef0f4bb59cda68d966b6d288/f36ef1f210bf460e9e0f43be78fb0bd5/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AW3Cx%2BHTML5.0x%2B1T2019%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40427074c031424e189e4898d969d7dcd9">
    <img src="https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/9df11f203d18addb831da2f379cb49a5/asset-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2019+type@asset+block/tags.png" style="margin: 0.1em;" alt="Diagram of an element" title="Diagram of an element" width="350">
  </a></div>
</div>

Most tags have open and close versions, but there are a few strange ones.  We'll learn more about these later, but we generally refer to the strange ones as "self closing" tags.   Usually these tags represent an element that is completely described by its attributes, and thus there is no need for other content.  So if you see something like this:

```html
<img src="https://goo.gl/pVxY0e" alt="Floating Flower"/>
```

... then you should know that the slash at the end of the open tag is sort of a shorthand for a close tag, so you won't see any other indication that this element is now complete.  There are also a few tags that don't even use the '/' at the end, they just don't have any close tag at all.  This works because all of the information this tag needs is declared in an "attribute".


#### Knowledge check 1.3.4

Which is the correct nesting of these elements?

  1. "p" inside "body" inside "html"
  2. "html" inside "body" inside "p"
  3. "p" inside "body" inside "head"

  Ans: 1 <br/>
  Explanation: The top element is the "html" element, which should contain a "head" and a "body" as siblings, not nested in each other. A "p" element belongs in the body, not in the head.


### Comments

Computers are great at reading computer languages, but it's not always easy for humans.  Comments are a way of adding some text that is primarily targeted towards human readers.

Every programming language I've used has some way of representing comments.  HTML5 is no exception.  If you want to add something in your file that you want the browser to completely ignore, there's a special tag for that (unsurprisingly called a "comment tag"):

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

An HTML comment tag starts with `<!--' and ends with '-->`, meaning that as the computer is reading through your HTML file, if it sees `<!--` it will ignore everything it sees until it comes across `-->`.  There is no open or close tag, just a comment tag.  Unlike most other things in HTML5, comments cannot be nested.  If you try that, like:

```html
<!--
Beginning of comment
  <!-- comment nested inside -->
This is after the nested comment
-->
```

Then the computer will see the beginning of the comment tag and start ignoring everything until it sees `-->`, including the second `<!--`.  Once it sees `-->` it assumes the comment is done and goes back to processing everything it sees as HTML code and content, even though the writer may have meant it to be a comment.

Like most other tags, it can span multiple lines of your source file.  This can be really convenient when you have a lot to say:

```html
<!--
If you want some good advice,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
-->
```

Comments are also commonly used in development to block out bits of code, whether for testing or leaving unfinished business in the file:

```html
<!-- Not sure if I want this wording or not:
<p>Eighty seven years ago, a bunch of guys started a new country</p>
-->
```

It's important to remember that just as HTML, CSS and JavaScript are three different languages, they each have their own way of writing comments.  This might seem confusing, but it's actually kind of important that the HTML comments, at least, differ from the others.  As for the exact form of those comments, we'll cover that in good time.


### Attributes

Most of what we'll cover about attributes will come later, but I wanted to introduce the idea briefly. Basically, a given element on your Web page can be distinguished by any number of unique or common attributes.  You can identify it uniquely with an 'id' attribute, or group it with a class of other elements by setting the 'class' attribute.

Attributes in HTML are written inside the opening tag like this:

```html
<p id="paragraph-1" class="regular-paragraphs">
   Call me Ishmael . . .
 </p>
```

The paragraph above has a unique identifier, "paragraph-1" and is part of a class of "regular-paragraphs". The letters inside the quotes have no meaning to the computer, they just need to be consistent. They are actually strings, which, as we will soon learn, suggest that if you want to have another paragraph in this class, it has to say "regular-paragraphs", not "regular" or "Regular-Paragraphs" or any other variation.

Again, the fact that the computer does not care what we put in those strings (except for some restrictions) means we can use them to convey meaning to a human developer. I could just as easily have said id='x' and class='y', but anyone looking at that would have no hint what the significance of x and y are. Best practice is to name these things to increase clarity, consistency and brevity.

But more about attributes in the next module.


### All together now

One key to understanding HTML, or any computer language, is to be sure that you avoid ambiguity, because computers generally are not good at judgement calls. For example, you could streamline HTML so that whenever you see a <p> tag, you start a new paragraph, no close tag needed. That might work most of the time, but that would prevent you from nesting one element inside another, as the computer could not know if you meant the new element to be nested or a successor.

A human designer might be able to tell what you meant from the context, and knowing that mistakes happen choose the one she thinks is best suited in that case. A computer, on the other hand, has difficulty with a task like that, so it is helpful to use a close tag that matches the open tag to make things absolutely clear.

The computer, on the other hand, will only see one paragraph and layout accordingly.</p>
  </div>
  <p></p>

That's why __the first thing you need in any HTML file__ is a tag to tell you what type of HTML file it is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

#### Everything in HTML

It may seem redundant, but the next bit tells the computer where the actual HTML code begins, using an <html> tag:

```html
<html>
```

Nearly every HTML document has two parts. The 'body' is the main content of the page, containing text, images, tables and so on. The 'head' comes before the 'body' (on top?). It is where you put information about the document that does not really go in the body, AKA 'meta-' information. Things like what kind of character set the page is using, where the browser can find style tips, and what the title of the page is (which might be different from the title the user reads) all go in the `<head>`. If you have been paying attention, you should be able to create a very basic html file, in the right form, without any content. Hint, for the head of the document you would write:

```html
<head>
 
</head>
```

You may recall the paragraph tag `<p>` that we used in the example above. Try inserting a paragraph into the body of your new document.  You should end up with something that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
   </head>
   <body>
     <p>
       As my English teacher used to say, 'One sentence does not a paragraph make'!
     </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

### Activity - View source

Pick 5 Web sites and do a "View Source" on each of them by right clicking on the page and selecting "view source" from the context menu:

+ How many are using HTML5?<br/>(Hint: if you have trouble finding sites that don't use HTML5, try looking at older sites)
+ How many have proper `<body>` and `<html>` close tags?
+ Is there a lot of white space? Why or why not?

Please share your findings in the discussion forum below.


## 1.4 Character encoding

### Character encoding

A character can be any letter, digit or symbol that makes up words and languages. English alphabets and digits 'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9' are all considered characters. Other examples of characters include the Latin letter á or the Chinese ideograph [請](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/images/35531.png) or the Devanagari character [ह](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/images/2361.png). A __character set__ is a collection of characters (letters and symbols) in a writing system.

Each character is assigned a particular number called a __code point__. These code points are stored in computer memory in the form of bytes (a unit of data in computer memory). In technical terms, we say the character is __encoded__ using one or more bytes.

Basically, all the characters are stored in computer language and a __character encoding__ is the awesome dictionary that is going to help us decode this computer language into something we can understand. In technical terms, it is what is used as a reference to map code points into bytes to store in computer memory; then when you use a character in your HTML, the bytes are then read back into code points using the character encoding as a reference. 

Examples of character encodings include:

+ _ASCII_: contains letters, characters and a limited set of symbols and punctuation for the English language
+ _Windows-1252 (Latin1)_: Windows character set that supports 256 different code points
+ _ISO-8859-6_: contains letters and symbols based on the Arabic script
+ _Unicode_: contains characters for most living languages and scripts in the world

When you code in HTML, you must specify the encoding you wish your page to use. Providing no encoding or the wrong one is pretty much like providing the wrong dictionary to decode. It can display your text incorrectly or cause your data to not be read correctly by a search engine. A character encoding declaration in your HTML is also important to process unfamiliar characters entered in forms by users, URLs generated by scripts, etc.

__You should always use the Unicode character encoding UTF-8 for your Web pages__, and avoid 'legacy' encodings such as ASCII, Windows-1252 and ISO-8859-6 mentioned above. Do not use the UTF-16 Unicode encoding either.

It is important to note that it is not enough to simply declare your encoding at the top of the web page. __You have to ensure that your editor saves the file in UTF-8__ also. Most editors will do that these days, but you should check.
