## 1.2 The big three: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

### Vague but exciting!

Twenty eight years ago today, a proposal was sent internally at CERN outlying a universal linked information system. Dubbed 'Information Management: A proposal', pictured below, the proposal was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall, who described it as 'vague but exciting'.

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;flex-flow:row wrap;">

  </a></div>
</div>

Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s vision for universality enabled the development of a high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any other documents.

The World Wide Web was initially created to make it easier to share research papers. It is a system of interlinked ‘hypertext’ documents that are accessed via the Internet; in essence, an information space. While he did not invent hypertext systems, Berners-Lee proposed using them 'to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.'

His breakthrough was to link hypertext to the Internet and he used three technologies to do this:

+ HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication for the Web.
+ HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main mark-up language for creating Web pages and information that can be displayed on a Web browser.

Web addresses or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) are used to reference a Web page.
In the following pages, we present HTML through what is usually called the big 3 (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript), the hypertext concept and the browser, an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web.


### HTML5, CSS and JS

#### What is HTML5?

When people say 'HTML5', they usually mean a bit more than just the 5th version of the "HyperText Markup Language". Modern Web pages and Web applications are generally composed of at least three components, so what people often mean when they say 'HTML5' is the trio of languages: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The 'HTML' part contains all the content, organized into a logical structure.  This is the part that an author might be most concerned with: the words, chapter headings, figures, diagrams, etc. 

While there have been numerous versions of HTML since its inception, our focus in this course is the most recent version, HTML5. HTML5 was developed to provide more powerful and flexible ways for developers to create dynamic Web pages.


#### CSS

The 'CSS' part (version 3 being current) is all about the presentation or style of the page; what it looks like without too much regard for the specific content. We'll be going into more detail on that later in this course, but for now, think of it as the way you might specify a "theme" in a word processing document, setting fonts, sizes, indentations and whatever else may apply to what it looks like.


#@### JavaScript

The 'JavaScript', or 'JS' for short, part is about the actions a page can take such as interaction with the user, and customizing and changing the page according to any number of parameters.  This is what allows a Web page to be more than just a document, but potentially a Web application, with nearly unlimited possibilities.  We will not be doing much with JavaScript in this course, but you should know that it is an important leg of the stool for modern Web pages.


### Hypertext

A fundamental key to the World Wide Web is the concept of "Hypertext".  Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together, not unlike using footnotes, except much easier and more flexible. The idea was to "Mark Up" your document with links and define how to break it down into different segments (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.)

That's why, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee began to create a definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate Hyperlinks in a text document.

</div>

He envisioned a technology that would facilitate thoroughly interconnected documents. He wanted authors to be able to connect an idea in one document to the source of the idea in another, or connect a statement with the data that backs up that statement. Traditionally, this kind of thing was done with footnotes and bibliographies, which can be cumbersome. This information should be easily transferable from one place to another, so that in reading one document, it is easy to access everything related (linked) to it. Tim Berners-Lee imagined a "Web" of interconnected documents.

He used the metaphor of a Web to emphasize the importance of connections between documents. It was not just a long list of details, but rather a sea of information stretching out in all directions. This sea of information was navigated by a new tool called a "Browser".


#### Knowledge check 1.2.3

True or False: The primary purpose of HTML is to assist formatting of text.

  Ans: False, xTrue<br/>
  Explication: Though there are a few HTML tags used for formatting, HTML is primarily designed to help organize a document semantically. CSS is used for formatting and other aspects of design.


### The browser

The Internet existed long before the Web came to fruition, and lots of organizations were connected to it, including schools, companies and government organizations.  As things progressed through the 80's, the Internet was used for file transfers, newsgroups (a kind of open forum), email and other conveniences.

At the time there were a number of different programs like '[fetch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetch_(FTP_client))', ['gopher'](http://www.yourdictionary.com/gopher#Noun-3)' and '[archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine)' that were used to download, browse and search for files.  Typically, you might use one tool to search for the location of files of interest, then another to copy that file to a local machine.  Then, you still needed more tools to read that file.  If it was text, you could use a text editor, if it was a formatted document you might need a word processor, if a picture you would need an image viewer and so on.

[Marc Andreesen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) conceived of a solution that would put all the pieces together in one app, making it easy for users to browse all the different sorts of information and data on the World Wide Web.  Together with others, he started the "Mosaic" project.

Though not technically the first browser, Mosaic was the first one that many people experienced and played a big part in popularizing the concept of the World Wide Web and the Web browser. It provided a simple graphical way to access and browse the various resources on the Internet. Instead of using different tools to download and view information on the Internet, a simple click on a link would present the information in a graphical window. In many ways, it is the ancestor of most modern browsers.


### Activity - Explore the Web

Exploring the Web, "Then and Now":

+ Go to archive.org and find the earliest instance of the Web site: www.google.com.
+ Note the differences between that and its current Web site.
+ Find an old news story, see how far back you can go (hint: start by looking at yahoo.com).
+ In general, what differences do you notice between Web sites from the 90's and Web sites today?
+ Post your observations and findings in the discussion forum below.


## 1.3 Elements, tags and attributes

### Putting the "M" in HTML

So the "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean? Essentially, it means to annotate a document with extra information. Things like where different sections and paragraphs begin and end, which part is the title, which things should be emphasized and so on.  

There are many ways to markup a document, but HTML borrows a technique from an ancestor language, SGML ([Standard Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language)), which uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") to separate the annotations from the regular text.  In HTML these annotations are called "tags".

For example, consider the following chunk of HTML code:

```html
   <body>
    <h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
    <p>
      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . .
    </p>
    . . .
    <p>
      . . . it is a far, far better rest
      that I go to than I have ever known.
    </p>
  </body>
```

If you eliminated everything in between the angle brackets from the text, for most purposes it would still read the same:

<pre style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6px;"><code>A Tale of Two Cities</code><br>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . .<br>  . . .<br>. . . it is a far, far better rest<br>    that I go to than I have ever known.</pre>

Once you know that everything in angle brackets is "meta-information", it leaves a lot of flexibility. You can put a lot of different things in between those brackets without any of it showing up (directly) in your finished document. And, though you don't usually see directly what's in those angle brackets, they can often have a big effect on what your Web page looks like as well as how it responds and interacts with you.


#### Try It Out!

I expect at this point you may be longing to write some HTML code.  As is the tradition in programming tutorials, we'll pause here to create a simple "Hello HTML" program. Please choose any Web editor of your liking (see in the subsection "Course tools" - Module 0).

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget). But it's better to use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.


### Programming "Hello HTML"

You can build and edit your HTML pages by either using online editors or editors that you can install on your machine like Visual Studio Code.


#### Using online editors:

Both [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) are two online editors that you can use to create HTML Web pages. The following two videos show you how to create your first HTML page using [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

### Elements

If you are sitting at a coffee shop next to a table of Web developers, you will probably hear three words quite a bit:  'Tags', 'Attributes' and 'Elements' (or sometimes 'DOM elements', same thing just more precise and wordy).

'Elements' are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, or a header is an element, even the body is an element.  Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header elements, paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the DOM.

<svg width="600" height="300"><g transform="translate(120,20)"><g class="node" transform="translate(0,130)"><circle r="15" style="fill: rgb(255, 255, 255);"></circle><text x="-5" dy="1.4em" text-anchor="end" style="fill-opacity: 1;">html</text></g></g></svg>

Consider the figure above.  It contains a single 'html' element.  It turns out this includes within it the entire content of your html file.  If you click on the "html" node, you'll find that it contains two components, a head and a body.  Clicking on each of those will reveal their respective contents.  This structure is what we computer scientists call a "tree".  Any given element (except for the outermost 'html' element) is wholly contained inside another element, referred to as the "parent" element.  Not surprisingly, the elements that a given element contains are its "child" elements.  And, yes, children of a common parent are often referred to as "siblings".

Thus in the example above, the top element is the html element, which contains just two elements, the head and body.  The head element contains a title element and the body contains an 'h1' element and a 'p' element.  In a more typical example, the body would contain many more children, but for our purpose this is enough.

That may be a great picture, but how do we represent such a structure in a text file?  Well, that's where "tags" come in.
