### Grading policy

#### Passing

This course is graded as pass/fail, meaning you will either be given a passing score or a failing score. 
__The score required to pass this course is 70%.__

Check your progress from time to time! (see the "Progress" tab above on the far right).

You will be graded on...

1. Module exercises

  At the end of each module, you will find a small handful of questions, named after "Exercises - Module x" (where x is the module number). These are designed to assess your progress in the course, module after module. Questions will be in the form of multiple choice, checkbox or text input problems.

  Module exercises count towards 75% of the grade.

2. Final exam

  The final exam is available at the end of Module 6. The final exam consists of questions (multiple choice, checkbox or text input problems) covering the entirety of the course.

  The final exam counts towards 25% of the grade.


You __WILL NOT__ be graded on ...

+ In the "About the Web and W3C" section, we provide 2 simple quizzes. They do not count in the final grade.
+ You will find questions at the end of some pages. Each of these is called "knowledge check", and as the name indicates it, they are designed to test your retention of the knowledge, page after page.
+ There are activities throughout the course, as well as a global project that you will build module after module. These are to help you practice what you have learnt.


### Due dates

"HTML5&CSS Fundamentals" is a self-paced course that do not follow a set schedule. All course materials are completely available as soon as the course begins. Assignments and exams do not have start or due dates other than the official end date of the course.

_=> The course shows indicators for graded assignments, but no due dates._

There are exercises (or assignments) all over the course. It is __strongly suggested__ that you complete the exercises as promptly as possible at the end of each module of the course, because the content material will still be very fresh in your memories!

The free (audit track) and the paid (verified track) options are available in this course. It means that:

+ All course materials are completely available as soon as the course begins. However, students are no longer be able to audit an individual course free for an unlimited period of time. That period will vary, but is usually around four to six weeks for most courses.
+ Additionally, all graded assessments are now accessible only to students who purchase a certificate. Students who audit courses at no charge will continue to be able to access ungraded assessments.


### Verified certificate

To earn a verified certificate from this W3Cx course, you enroll in or upgrade to the verified track in the course, pay the certificate fee, [verify your identity](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_pursue_certs.html#sfd-verify-your-identity) using a webcam and a photo ID, and earn a passing grade.

There will be assignments (or exercises) all over the course. It is strongly suggested that you complete the exercises as promptly as possible at the end of each module of the course.

As soon as you reach the minimum passing score (70%), your self-paced certificate will be __automatically delivered__. The certificate will appear on your dashboard and Progress page.

Note that Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course. Your final grade appears on your __Progress__ page and on your dashboard. If you need a record of your grade, you can print your __Progress__ page or dashboard. This course does not offer Honor of Code certificates.

## Course practical information

### Getting around the course

If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started. Even if you've used edX for other courses, the information here will help orient you to how this course is laid out. 
You are also welcome to register to DemoX, which is a fun and interactive edX course course designed to help you explore the edX learning experience.

#### Layout of the course

The HTML5&CSS Fundamentals course is composed of 6 weeks/modules, covering 6 topics. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you'll need to learn for the module 's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit will generally have some video content, reading material, an activity, and one or two assessment questions to test your knowledge. Those assessment questions will be called "knowledge check" questions throughout the course. The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the exercises (and the final exam!) that you will find at the end of each module/week, you should learn the material in all the units.


#### Bookmarks

It is now possible to bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the related documentation.


#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds. 

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and __they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate__. Read [this documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators) to find more.

Note that past learners were sometimes experiencing a bug where pages that included a discussion component were not listed as completed on the course outline. This bug has since been fixed, but if you notice another specific unit that is giving trouble, please review the [progress indicator documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators), and if you are still having trouble, please send a link to the specific unit to our learner support team at info@edx.org so that we can check if anything is amiss.


#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the __discussion boards (or forums)__. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.


#### Other resources

+ [edX Learners' Guide](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/index.html): The guide answers common questions about topics like getting started in an online course, earning certificates, participating in course discussions, etc.
+ [edX Student FAQ](https://www.edx.org/about/student-faq): This FAQ answers a lot of questions about the edX student experience. You should at least read over the questions so if you encounter any issues during the course, you can refer back to this document for help.


### Course forums

This course provides discussion forums. Forums will be available at the end of most course subsections, so you create posts on the topic being discussed in a particular subsection. You are free to use the forums to connect with other students. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post as either a question or a discussion. When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question or a discussion.

+ A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion administration team and the course community can provide answers -- a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions
+ A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections, and inviting community participation.

As shown on the right, a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation bubble image identifies posts that start discussions:

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, select __Discussion__ at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop- down list. (__All Discussions__ is selected by default.) Only posts about the topic you select appear in the list of posts.

You are free to use the forums to connect with other students and the instructor, as well as ask questions about the material. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

In addition, students will have a varied level of experience with the technologies covered in this course, so questions will range from the very basic to the very advanced. You are encouraged to assist other students and share your experiences with the product. Thanks a lot!

Find out more [about discussion forums](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/sfd_discussions/anatomy.html) in the edX Learner's Guide.

edX is a global platform: as such, when creating posts, please be respectful of all cultures, creeds and religions.


### Forum guidelines and best practices

Below are guidelines and best practices for productive collaboration and discussion in our course.

+ __Participate!__ It will enhance your learning experience and some discussions may be subject to examination.
+ __Help each other!__ We encourage you to reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
+ __Be polite!__ Opinions are good, but please respect others’ opinions as well.
+ __Do not cheat!__ See collaboration guidelines below to see what’s acceptable.


#### Collaboration Guidelines

These will help you use the forum appropriately as an aid to learning the material. We encourage you to:

+ Discuss the general approach to solving a problem.
+ Share your work results (following proposed activities or other).
+ Work jointly to come up with the steps for a solution, or to create an original work.
+ Ask for a hint or clarification in the discussion board, or several hints for that matter, if you get stuck while solving a problem.
+ Please search (use the search button) for an answer to your question in the discussion board before posting. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions and you may find the question and answer without needing to post it yourself.
It is NOT ok to:

+ Post the solution to a problem in the discussion board or somewhere else on the Web. If you need help, post errors you’re encountering, but not your answers.
+ Take someone else's solution and simply copy the answers from their solution.

These actions are considered to be cheating. Violations of these guidelines may result in posts being deleted or your account being deactivated.


#### Guidelines to navigate and interact on the forum

The discussion forum helps improve your ability to search and talk about many different topics throughout the course. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ At the end of some pages, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Use a descriptive and specific title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners having the same issue.
+ Use “netiquette,” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
  + Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
  + Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).
  + Avoid repeating letters or characters like this: reeepeeaattingggg chaaracterrrss
  + Avoid excessive punctuation if possible (e.g. !!!!!!!! or ??????)
  + It’s fine to make suggestions, but avoid negative commentary and please do not “flame” anyone.


### A bug to report

In case you find a broken link or a typo or any other factual problem related to the content material, we would appreciate if you could report it in the discussion forum below. We will do our best to check this forum on a regular basis, and provide a solution. Thank you.


## Course tools

### Web browsers

Not surprisingly, it would be helpful to have a browser (short for "Web Browser") installed so that you can see the end result of your source code. Most common browsers are [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (and IE), [Firefox](https://firefox.com/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), etc.

Look for the [history of Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser#History) (on Wikipedia). An interesting resource is the [Browser and Platform Market Share](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php) (updated regularly).


#### Viewing your work

There are a couple of easy ways you can use a browser to view your work.

First, you can open the file in your browser.  Typically, if you navigate to an html file and open it the system will open it with a browser by default. 


### Web editors

Any text editor will do!

The first computer programs were actually [configurations of connections between circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programming). A programmer would design the setup, then a host of people would reconfigure patch cords and the like to realize the program. The next step was flipping bits to write machine code directly to the computer memory. Fortunately, we won't be going back that far in creating source for Web apps.

The next step in programming history was made using very basic text editors. Text could be edited one line at a time, and there was no concept of GUI ([Graphics User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)). Now, it turns out, that is enough to create a Web page, as its source is simply text. But that would be painfully tedious.  Stepping up, we finally had text editors that were more visually oriented, in fact one early example was called "Vim" (previously known as Vi - for "Visual").

Simple visual editors are quite capable; in fact a great deal of the Web was built using [visual editors of one sort or another](http://xkcd.com/378/) ([xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) webcomic strip entitled "Real Programmers"). __Thus if you're familiar with Notepad or TextEdit or even Vim, you can produce a Web page.__ Of course, innovation didn't stop there and visual editors have incrementally improved to help you write code in particular languages or detect errors, etc.

One caveat: you need to make sure that whatever editor you choose will save to a "plain text" format ('.txt'). Some editors will save to other formats by default (".rtf", ".doc", etc.) so you need to make sure you save your source code as plain text.

All that is to say that there are lots of options when it comes to creating Web pages. There are, of course, GUI drag-and-drop solutions, where you can create a Web page as you would a diagram or picture, but we want to learn the nitty-gritty details of HTML, so we'll ignore those options.


#### A non-exhaustive list

Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:

+ [Notepad](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - on Windows PC's
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
+ [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
+ TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're [saving as plain text](https://discussions.apple.com/message/5014514#5014514), not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
+ [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
+ [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) - another cross platform editor, created by [GitHub](https://github.com/).
+ [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - great editors on which the Internet was built, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.


#### Knowledge check

If your editor saves in a variety of formats, which of the following should you be sure to use for your Web page?

  1. `.exe` or Executable
  2. `.rtf` or Rich Text Format
  3. `.txt` or plain text
  4. `.docx` or MS Document File

  Ans: 3 <br/>
  H is for HyperText


### Online editors

To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, you will use the following tools. Pretty much all the course's examples will actually use these tools.

+ JS Bin logo JS Bin (https://jsbin.com/)

  JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Some of the course's examples are on JS Bin.

  Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as this [one](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-tools-of-the-trade-jsbin--net-36843) or that [other one](https://jsbin.com/help/getting-started/) or on YouTube ([video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTooRDWOrIu23P3SEZ3luIUq)). The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.

+ CodePen logo CodePen (https://codepen.io/)

  CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming and teaching. We are providing a short live coding video on how to use CodePen at the beginning of Module 1

Here's an article which will be of-interest if you use CodePen: [Things you can do with CodePen](https://codepen.io/brentmiller/post/things-you-can-do-with-codepen) [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].

There are many other handy tools such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) (Lea Verou's tool). Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc. Sharing them using JSBin, or similar tools, would be really appreciated.
