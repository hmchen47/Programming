### Grading policy

#### Passing

This course is graded as pass/fail, meaning you will either be given a passing score or a failing score. 
__The score required to pass this course is 70%.__

Check your progress from time to time! (see the "Progress" tab above on the far right).

You will be graded on...

1. Module exercises

  At the end of each module, you will find a small handful of questions, named after "Exercises - Module x" (where x is the module number). These are designed to assess your progress in the course, module after module. Questions will be in the form of multiple choice, checkbox or text input problems.

  Module exercises count towards 75% of the grade.

2. Final exam

  The final exam is available at the end of Module 6. The final exam consists of questions (multiple choice, checkbox or text input problems) covering the entirety of the course.

  The final exam counts towards 25% of the grade.


You __WILL NOT__ be graded on ...

+ In the "About the Web and W3C" section, we provide 2 simple quizzes. They do not count in the final grade.
+ You will find questions at the end of some pages. Each of these is called "knowledge check", and as the name indicates it, they are designed to test your retention of the knowledge, page after page.
+ There are activities throughout the course, as well as a global project that you will build module after module. These are to help you practice what you have learnt.


### Due dates

"HTML5&CSS Fundamentals" is a self-paced course that do not follow a set schedule. All course materials are completely available as soon as the course begins. Assignments and exams do not have start or due dates other than the official end date of the course.

_=> The course shows indicators for graded assignments, but no due dates._

There are exercises (or assignments) all over the course. It is __strongly suggested__ that you complete the exercises as promptly as possible at the end of each module of the course, because the content material will still be very fresh in your memories!

The free (audit track) and the paid (verified track) options are available in this course. It means that:

+ All course materials are completely available as soon as the course begins. However, students are no longer be able to audit an individual course free for an unlimited period of time. That period will vary, but is usually around four to six weeks for most courses.
+ Additionally, all graded assessments are now accessible only to students who purchase a certificate. Students who audit courses at no charge will continue to be able to access ungraded assessments.


### Verified certificate

To earn a verified certificate from this W3Cx course, you enroll in or upgrade to the verified track in the course, pay the certificate fee, [verify your identity](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_pursue_certs.html#sfd-verify-your-identity) using a webcam and a photo ID, and earn a passing grade.

There will be assignments (or exercises) all over the course. It is strongly suggested that you complete the exercises as promptly as possible at the end of each module of the course.

As soon as you reach the minimum passing score (70%), your self-paced certificate will be __automatically delivered__. The certificate will appear on your dashboard and Progress page.

Note that Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course. Your final grade appears on your __Progress__ page and on your dashboard. If you need a record of your grade, you can print your __Progress__ page or dashboard. This course does not offer Honor of Code certificates.

## Course practical information

### Getting around the course

If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started. Even if you've used edX for other courses, the information here will help orient you to how this course is laid out. 
You are also welcome to register to DemoX, which is a fun and interactive edX course course designed to help you explore the edX learning experience.

#### Layout of the course

The HTML5&CSS Fundamentals course is composed of 6 weeks/modules, covering 6 topics. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you'll need to learn for the module 's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit will generally have some video content, reading material, an activity, and one or two assessment questions to test your knowledge. Those assessment questions will be called "knowledge check" questions throughout the course. The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the exercises (and the final exam!) that you will find at the end of each module/week, you should learn the material in all the units.


#### Bookmarks

It is now possible to bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the related documentation.


#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds. 

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and __they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate__. Read [this documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators) to find more.

Note that past learners were sometimes experiencing a bug where pages that included a discussion component were not listed as completed on the course outline. This bug has since been fixed, but if you notice another specific unit that is giving trouble, please review the [progress indicator documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_check_progress.html#sfd-progress-indicators), and if you are still having trouble, please send a link to the specific unit to our learner support team at info@edx.org so that we can check if anything is amiss.


#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the __discussion boards (or forums)__. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.

Note: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: http://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
+ CodePen: http://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.


#### Other resources

+ [edX Learners' Guide](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/index.html): The guide answers common questions about topics like getting started in an online course, earning certificates, participating in course discussions, etc.
+ [edX Student FAQ](https://www.edx.org/about/student-faq): This FAQ answers a lot of questions about the edX student experience. You should at least read over the questions so if you encounter any issues during the course, you can refer back to this document for help.


### Course forums

This course provides discussion forums. Forums will be available at the end of most course subsections, so you create posts on the topic being discussed in a particular subsection. You are free to use the forums to connect with other students. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post as either a question or a discussion. When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question or a discussion.

+ A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion administration team and the course community can provide answers -- a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions
+ A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections, and inviting community participation.

As shown on the right, a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation bubble image identifies posts that start discussions:

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, select __Discussion__ at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop- down list. (__All Discussions__ is selected by default.) Only posts about the topic you select appear in the list of posts.

You are free to use the forums to connect with other students and the instructor, as well as ask questions about the material. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

In addition, students will have a varied level of experience with the technologies covered in this course, so questions will range from the very basic to the very advanced. You are encouraged to assist other students and share your experiences with the product. Thanks a lot!

Find out more [about discussion forums](http://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/sfd_discussions/anatomy.html) in the edX Learner's Guide.

edX is a global platform: as such, when creating posts, please be respectful of all cultures, creeds and religions.


### Forum guidelines and best practices

Below are guidelines and best practices for productive collaboration and discussion in our course.

+ __Participate!__ It will enhance your learning experience and some discussions may be subject to examination.
+ __Help each other!__ We encourage you to reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
+ __Be polite!__ Opinions are good, but please respect others’ opinions as well.
+ __Do not cheat!__ See collaboration guidelines below to see what’s acceptable.


#### Collaboration Guidelines

These will help you use the forum appropriately as an aid to learning the material. We encourage you to:

+ Discuss the general approach to solving a problem.
+ Share your work results (following proposed activities or other).
+ Work jointly to come up with the steps for a solution, or to create an original work.
+ Ask for a hint or clarification in the discussion board, or several hints for that matter, if you get stuck while solving a problem.
+ Please search (use the search button) for an answer to your question in the discussion board before posting. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions and you may find the question and answer without needing to post it yourself.
It is NOT ok to:

+ Post the solution to a problem in the discussion board or somewhere else on the Web. If you need help, post errors you’re encountering, but not your answers.
+ Take someone else's solution and simply copy the answers from their solution.

These actions are considered to be cheating. Violations of these guidelines may result in posts being deleted or your account being deactivated.


#### Guidelines to navigate and interact on the forum

The discussion forum helps improve your ability to search and talk about many different topics throughout the course. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ At the end of some pages, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Use a descriptive and specific title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners having the same issue.
+ Use “netiquette,” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
  + Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
  + Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).
  + Avoid repeating letters or characters like this: reeepeeaattingggg chaaracterrrss
  + Avoid excessive punctuation if possible (e.g. !!!!!!!! or ??????)
  + It’s fine to make suggestions, but avoid negative commentary and please do not “flame” anyone.


### A bug to report

In case you find a broken link or a typo or any other factual problem related to the content material, we would appreciate if you could report it in the discussion forum below. We will do our best to check this forum on a regular basis, and provide a solution. Thank you.


## Course tools

### Web browsers

Not surprisingly, it would be helpful to have a browser (short for "Web Browser") installed so that you can see the end result of your source code. Most common browsers are [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) (and IE), [Firefox](https://firefox.com/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), etc.

Look for the [history of Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser#History) (on Wikipedia). An interesting resource is the [Browser and Platform Market Share](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php) (updated regularly).


#### Viewing your work

There are a couple of easy ways you can use a browser to view your work.

First, you can open the file in your browser.  Typically, if you navigate to an html file and open it the system will open it with a browser by default. 


### Web editors

Any text editor will do!

The first computer programs were actually [configurations of connections between circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programming). A programmer would design the setup, then a host of people would reconfigure patch cords and the like to realize the program. The next step was flipping bits to write machine code directly to the computer memory. Fortunately, we won't be going back that far in creating source for Web apps.

The next step in programming history was made using very basic text editors. Text could be edited one line at a time, and there was no concept of GUI ([Graphics User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)). Now, it turns out, that is enough to create a Web page, as its source is simply text. But that would be painfully tedious.  Stepping up, we finally had text editors that were more visually oriented, in fact one early example was called "Vim" (previously known as Vi - for "Visual").

Simple visual editors are quite capable; in fact a great deal of the Web was built using [visual editors of one sort or another](http://xkcd.com/378/) ([xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) webcomic strip entitled "Real Programmers"). __Thus if you're familiar with Notepad or TextEdit or even Vim, you can produce a Web page.__ Of course, innovation didn't stop there and visual editors have incrementally improved to help you write code in particular languages or detect errors, etc.

One caveat: you need to make sure that whatever editor you choose will save to a "plain text" format ('.txt'). Some editors will save to other formats by default (".rtf", ".doc", etc.) so you need to make sure you save your source code as plain text.

All that is to say that there are lots of options when it comes to creating Web pages. There are, of course, GUI drag-and-drop solutions, where you can create a Web page as you would a diagram or picture, but we want to learn the nitty-gritty details of HTML, so we'll ignore those options.


#### A non-exhaustive list

Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:

+ [Notepad](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - on Windows PC's
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
+ [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
+ TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're [saving as plain text](https://discussions.apple.com/message/5014514#5014514), not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
+ [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
+ [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) - another cross platform editor, created by [GitHub](https://github.com/).
+ [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - great editors on which the Internet was built, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.


#### Knowledge check

If your editor saves in a variety of formats, which of the following should you be sure to use for your Web page?

  1. `.exe` or Executable
  2. `.rtf` or Rich Text Format
  3. `.txt` or plain text
  4. `.docx` or MS Document File

  Ans: 3 <br/>
  H is for HyperText


### Online editors

To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, you will use the following tools. Pretty much all the course's examples will actually use these tools.

+ JS Bin logo JS Bin (https://jsbin.com/)

  JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Some of the course's examples are on JS Bin.

  Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as this [one](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-tools-of-the-trade-jsbin--net-36843) or that [other one](https://jsbin.com/help/getting-started/) or on YouTube ([video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmT1r4krsTooRDWOrIu23P3SEZ3luIUq)). The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.

+ CodePen logo CodePen (https://codepen.io/)

  CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming and teaching. We are providing a short live coding video on how to use CodePen at the beginning of Module 1

Here's an article which will be of-interest if you use CodePen: [Things you can do with CodePen](https://codepen.io/brentmiller/post/things-you-can-do-with-codepen) [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].

There are many other handy tools such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/) (Lea Verou's tool). Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc. Sharing them using JSBin, or similar tools, would be really appreciated.


### W3C validators

For over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting [free and open source tools](http://w3c.github.io/developers/) used every day by __millions of Web developers and Web designers__. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the [W3C Developers tools](http://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/) site.


#### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks the [markup validity](http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics) of various Web document formats, such as HTML. Note that you are automatically directed to the Nu Html Checker when validating an HTML5 document.


#### CSS Validator

The [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.


#### Unicorn

[Unicorn](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/) is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.


#### Internationalization Checker

The [W3C Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of  issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.


#### Link Checker

The [W3C Link Checker](http://validator.w3.org/checklink) looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid [(X)HTML Markup](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



### W3C cheatsheet

The [W3C cheatsheet](http://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/) provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.

Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.

The W3C cheatsheet is only available as a [pure Web application](http://dev.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/doc/).


## About W3C and the Web

### What is W3C?

As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.

W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.


#### A few history bits

[Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) wrote a [proposal](http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then created the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in collaboration with [CERN](http://www.cern.ch/), where the Web originated (see information on the [original CERN Server](http://www.w3.org/Daemon/)), with support from DARPA and the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm).

In April 1995, Inria became the first European W3C host, followed by [Keio University of Japan](http://www.keio.ac.jp/) (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, [ERCIM](http://www.ercim.org/) took over the role of European W3C Host from Inria. In 2013, W3C announced [Beihang University](http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) as the fourth Host.

In addition to these four Host locations that employ W3C staff, there are W3C Offices around the globe that support the developer communities in their regions and organize local events. Find the one next to your place!


#### A few figures

As of January 2019, W3C is:

+ A [member](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List)-driven organization composed of over 478 companies, universities, start-ups, etc. from all over the world.

#### Sir Tim Berners-Lee named recipient of the ACM A.M. Turing Award

On Tuesday 4 April 2017, the ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, named Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as the recipient of the 2016 [ACM A.M. Turing Award](http://amturing.acm.org/). The Turing award is recognized as the highest distinction in Computer Science and is often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing”.

Sir Tim is being given this award for inventing the World Wide Web, the first Web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Web is considered one of the most influential computing innovations in history.



### The Web is amazing!

People often use the words "Internet" and "Web" interchangeably, but this usage is technically incorrect.

The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are [e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) and [ftp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) for example. One analogy equates the Internet to a road network where the Web is a car, the email is a bicycle, etc.  Read [this article](https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-the-internet-and-the-web-2483335) for more details about the difference between Internet and the Web.

The W3C community is passionate about creating free and open Web standards. The next video, created in partnership with Microsoft, explains why standards are important to maintain a royalty-free, Open Web Platform, as well as to help shape the Web of the future.

### Quizzes

1. What is the difference between Internet and Web?

  1. Internet and Web are the same thing
  2. Internet is a network of networks
  3. Web is an application of Internet

  Ans: 23 <br/>
  Explanation
  + The Internet is technically a network of a wide variety of networks. From the Wikipedia's definition: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."
  + The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are e-mail and ftp for example.
  + A precise definition of the Web is to be found in the "W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I" document: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."


2. What is the difference between HTML and HTTP?

  1. HTTP describes what's on the page and HTML allows sites to communicate with each other
  2. HTML describes what's on a page and HTTP allows the page to be communicated to a user
  3. HTML and HTTP are the same thing

  Ans: 2<br/>
  Explanation: HTTP precisely stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", and HTML is "HyperText Markup Language". It may be easy to confuse HTTP and HTML since they both have the word HyperText in their names! But, HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext (text using hyperlinks) between nodes, while HTML is the standard markup language used to create Web pages.



## Why accessibility is important

### What is Web accessibility?

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
> Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

The Web has become an essential aspect of our daily lives, and everyone should have access to this technology. Web accessibility focuses on ensuring equivalent access for people with disabilities. It is increasingly important to many organizations and governments from around the world, and has many business benefits. Access to information, including on the Web, is also recognized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).


#### Who is impacted?

Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing, learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:

+ Captions on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of hearing;
+ Clear and consistent layout for people with learning and cognitive disabilities;
+ Keyboard support for people with physical disabilities and who do not use a mouse;
+ Text alternatives for people with visual disabilities and who are using screen readers;


##### Web accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities

Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:

+ People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
+ People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
+ People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
+ People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own Web site;
+ People who are not fluent in the language of your particular Web site;

The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. More information is available in the [W3C Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) overview.

+ The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  + ISO 40500
  + EN 301 549

+ Four core principles of WCAG
  + Perceivable: people can see the content, or hear it
  + Operable: people can use the computer by typing, or by voice
  + Understandable: people get clear and simple language
  + Robust: people can use different assistive technologies


### First steps in Web accessibility

There are many simple Web accessibility improvements that you can implement and check right away, even when you are new to this topic. Two example excerpts are provided below on this page but you can find more tips and information from W3C/WAI:

+ [Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/)
+ [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary)


#### Example 1: Page title

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the Web page markup, they are the words `<title>` within the `<head>`.

__Check #1: There is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of a page, and it distinguishes the page from other Web pages.__

Example:

```html
<head>
...
<title>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page</title>
...
</head>
```


#### Example 2: Image text alternatives ("alt text")

Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.

__Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.__

Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.

```html
<a href="https://w3.org">
<img src="https://w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png" width="72" height="48" alt="World Wide Web Consortium">
</a>
```


## Why internationalization is important

### What is internationalization?

Access to the Web for all has been a fundamental concern and goal of the W3C since the beginning. It is easy to overlook the needs of people from cultures different to your own, or who use different languages or writing systems, but you have to ensure that any content or application that you design or develop is ready to support the international features that they will need.

'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' and the 'n'.

[W3C Internationalization Activity](https://www.w3.org/International/) works with W3C working groups and liaises with other organizations to make it possible to use Web technologies with different languages, scripts, and cultures.

During this course you will learn about some basic internationalisation features, such as character encoding and language declarations. If you don't use those features you will create barriers for people from different cultures who are trying to access your content. This is important even if you think you are only designing for a specific community – communities are made up of diverse individuals, and the Web stretches worldwide.


#### Unicode

Text in a computer or on the Web is composed of characters. Characters represent letters of the alphabet, punctuation, or other symbols.

Unicode is a universal character set, ie. a standard that defines, in one place, all the characters needed for writing languages in use on computers. It is a superset of all other character sets that have been encoded.

As a content author or developer, you should nowadays always [choose the UTF-8 character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings) for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single encoding to handle any character you are likely to meet. This greatly simplifies things.
