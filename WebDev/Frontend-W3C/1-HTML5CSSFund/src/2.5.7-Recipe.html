    <h2>Tom Yum Soup</h2>

    <img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/B7kqhLQ_vpqfKFuLbk4cWLEH8ps=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tom-yum-soup-best-3217653-Hero_2-5b9bbd8246e0fb00251aca99.jpg" alt="Thai Tom-Yum Soup" title="Thai Tom-Yum Soup" width=300>
  
    <p>At first sip of this Thai tom yum soup, you'll be overcome by the almost intoxicating flavors of lemongrass, garlic, lime, coconut milk, and chili combined with a chicken stock base and topped up with shrimp. If you like spicy, I recommend either fresh red chilies or getting yourself a bottle of chili oil and adding anywhere from a few drops to a few teaspoons. Or leave the chili out for a terrific mild tom yum. Once you've made this special Thai soup, it will likely stay on your family favorite list forever.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 to 14 medium shrimp (or 8 to 10 large, raw, shells left on or removed)</li>
      <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 stalk lemongrass (lower 1/3, finely minced)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons onion (minced)</li>
      <li>6 teaspoons galangal (or ginger)</li>
      <li>3 leaves kaffir lime (or bay leaves)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lime juice (or lemon juice)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 carrot (thickly sliced)</li>
      <li>1 to 2 cups shiitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 small zucchini (sliced into half-moons)</li>
      <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes (sliced in half)</li>
      <li>1/4 to 1/3 can coconut milk (adding more or less to taste)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup fresh coriander</li>
      <li>Optional: brown sugar (to taste)</li>
      <li>Optional: crushed chili pepper flakes (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Make it</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Pour stock into a deep cooking pot and switch heat to medium-high. Add prepared lemongrass, including upper sections of the stalk you didn't mince. Boil hard 5 to 6 minutes to soften.</li>
      <li>Add garlic, onion, galangal or ginger, lime leaves (or bay leaves), lime or lemon juice, fish sauce, soy sauce, and carrots. Reduce heat slightly, cover, and continue lightly boiling 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and zucchini, and continue lightly boiling another 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Add shrimp and cherry tomatoes. Cook 3 minutes, or until shrimp are pink and plump.</li>
      <li>Turn down the heat to low and add 1/4 can coconut milk plus more fish sauce to taste. This is where the soup comes to its ​perfection. Taste-test for the most flavorful you can make it, without tilting over into too-salty, adding more fish sauce until you're happy with the flavor.</li>

  <h2>Thai Iced Tea</h2>

  <img src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/XwMtF5sYhOhDgXKijKsGN8yo7_Y=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/real-thai-iced-tea-recipe-765458-11_preview-5b1985fd43a1030036819a72.jpeg" alt="Thai Iced Tea" title="Thai Iced Tea" width=300>

  <p>This recipe is for the creamy style of Thai iced tea that most Thai restaurants in America serve.</p>

  <p>While many Thai iced tea mixes often contain a low-grade powder or syrup, this authentic recipe gets its flavor from good-quality black tea and spices without any artificial colors. The best part is it's easy to make and far cheaper than buying it.</p>

  <p>Similar to hot Thai tea, real Thai iced tea is a mix of black tea, spices, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk. It's a great drink for fans of masala chai and other spiced or milky black teas.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons loose-leaf black tea</li>
    <li> piece star anise</li>
    <li>2 pods cardamom</li>
    <li>Optional: 1/2 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>Optional: 1/8 vanilla bean</li>
    <li>Optional: ground tamarind (to taste)</li>
    <li>Optional: 1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
    <li>1 cup water (boiling)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons evaporated milk</li>
    <li>Garnish: mint leaves</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps to Make it</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Steep the tea, star anise, cardamom, optional cinnamon stick, vanilla bean, tamarind powder, and almond extract in the boiling water for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Strain the tea.</li>
    <li>Stir in the sugar and sweetened condensed milk until both are completely dissolved.</li>
    <li>Fill two tall glasses with ice.</li>
    <li>Pour the tea over the ice, leaving an inch or so of space at the top for the evaporated milk.</li>
    <li>Top up with more ice if needed, and then drizzle with 1 teaspoon of evaporated milk on each glass of tea. If using mint leaves for garnish, add them now.</li>
  </ol>
