  <p id="idtest">Untrained neural network models are much like new-born babies: They are created ignorant of the world (if considering tabula rasa epistemological theory), and it is only through exposure to the world, i.e. a posteriori knowledge, that their ignorance is slowly revised. </p>

  <p id="idtest">Methods that are centered around modeling and prediction of a quantitative response variable (e.g. number of taxi pickups, number of bike rentals) are called regressions (and Ridge, LASSO, etc.). When the response variable is categorical, then the problem is no longer called a regression problem but is instead labeled as a classification problem.</p>

Create two paragraphs with the same id and run your code in a CodePen. What happens? We know the 
value of the id attribute must be unique, so why does it behave the way it does? Run your code 
through the W3C Markup Validator. Does it throw an error?

Result:
