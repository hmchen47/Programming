In this section of the course, we will look at CSS pseudo classes that are useful for giving instant feedback when the user's input is not valid. We will also look at the new JavaScript API introduced by HTML5 for validating forms and form elements.

In the following pages, we will first illustrate the concept of form validation with the `<input type="email"/>` field. It can be generalized to all kind of input types, such as url, number, etc. Some form attributes, such as `pattern`,  will also affect input field validity!

Form validation is [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=form-validation) by all modern browsers.
