### Getting around the course

If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started.

You are also welcome to register to [DemoX](https://www.edx.org/course/demox), which is a fun and interactive edX course designed to help you explore the edX learning experience.


#### Layout of the course

This course is composed of 6 weeks/modules. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you need to learn for the module 's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit generally has some video content, reading material, an activity, and one or two questions to test your knowledge. Those questions are called "_knowledge checks_". The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the exercises (and the final exam!) that is the end of each module, you should learn the material in all the units.


#### Bookmarks

You can bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the [related documentation](https://tinyurl.com/y5kzc6sf).


#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds.

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and __they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate__. Read [this documentation](https://tinyurl.com/y2q6sevt) to find more.


#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the __discussion boards (or forums)__. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.


__Note__: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: https://jsbin.com ([JS Bin tutorial](https://tinyurl.com/yxrpoqek))
+ CodePen: https://codepen.io ([CodePen tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/))

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactive online code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.

## Course forums


### Course forums

This course provides discussion forums. Forums are available at the end of most course subsections, so you create posts on the topic being discussed in a particular subsection. You are free to use the forums to connect with other students.

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post as either a question or a discussion. When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question or a discussion.

+ A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion administration team and the course community can provide answers -- a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions
+ A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections, and inviting community participation.
As shown on the right, a question mark icon "?" identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation bubble image identifies posts that start discussions.

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, select __Discussion__ at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop- down list. (All __Discussions__ is selected by default.) Only posts about the topic you select appear in the list of posts.

You are free to use the forums to connect with other students and the instructor, as well as ask questions about the material. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

In addition, students will have a varied level of experience with the technologies covered in this course, so questions will range from the very basic to the very advanced. You are encouraged to assist other students and share your experiences with the product. Thanks a lot!

Find out more about [discussion forums](https://tinyurl.com/y69qq39p) in the edX Help Center.

edX is a global platform: as such, when creating posts, please be respectful of all cultures, creeds and religions.


### Discussion forum best practices

Below are guidelines and best practices for productive collaboration and discussion in our course.

+ __Participate!__ It will enhance your learning experience and some discussions may be subject to examination.
+ __Help each other!__ We encourage you to reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
+ __Be polite!__ Opinions are good, but please respect others’ opinions as well.
+ __Do not cheat!__ See collaboration guidelines below to see what’s acceptable.


#### Collaboration guidelines

These will help you use the forum appropriately as an aid to learning the material. We encourage you to:

+ Discuss the general approach to solving a problem.
+ Share your work results (following proposed activities or other).
+ Work jointly to come up with the steps for a solution, or to create an original work.
+ Ask for a hint or clarification in the discussion board, or several hints for that matter, if you get stuck while solving a problem.
+ Please search (use the search button) for an answer to your question in the discussion board before posting. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions and you may find the question and answer without needing to post it yourself.

It is NOT ok to:

+ Post the solution to a problem in the discussion board or somewhere else on the Web. If you need help, post errors you’re encountering, but not your answers.
+ Take someone else's solution and simply copy the answers from their solution.

These actions are considered to be cheating. Violations of these guidelines may result in posts being deleted or your account being deactivated.


#### Guidelines to navigate and interact on the forum

The discussion forum helps improve your ability to search and talk about many different topics throughout the course. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ At the end of some pages, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Use a descriptive and specific title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners having the same issue.
+ Use “netiquette,” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
  + Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
  + Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).
  + Avoid repeating letters or characters like this: reeepeeaattingggg chaaracterrrss
  + Avoid excessive punctuation if possible (e.g. !!!!!!!! or ??????)
  + It’s fine to make suggestions, but avoid negative commentary and please do not “flame” anyone.



## Course tools

### Web browsers

Not surprisingly, it would be helpful to have a browser (short for "Web Browser") installed so that you can see the end result of your source code.

Most common browsers for the desktop are Microsoft Edge (and IE), Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Brave, etc.

Look for the [history of Web browsers](https://tinyurl.com/yyp4lo2c) (on Wikipedia). An interesting resource is the [Browser and Platform Market Share](https://tinyurl.com/zk7er8v) (updated regularly).


#### Viewing your work

There are a couple of easy ways you can use a browser to view your work.

First, you open the file in your browser. Typically, if you navigate to an html file and open it, the system will open it with a browser by default.


### Web editors

While any text editor, like NotePad or TextEdit, can be used to create Web pages, they don't necessarily offer a lot of help towards that end. Other options offer more facilities for error checking, syntax coloring and saving some typing by filling things out for you.

Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:

+ [Notepad](https://tinyurl.com/kfhnndv) - on Windows PC's
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://tinyurl.com/ortxxge) - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
+ [XCode](https://tinyurl.com/5r4auez) - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
+ TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're [saving as plain text](https://tinyurl.com/y4ww4m64), not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
+ [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
+ [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) - another cross platform editor, created by [GitHub](https://github.com/).
+ [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - great editors on which the Internet was built, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.


### Online editors

To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, we use the following interactive online editors. Pretty much all the course's examples actually use these tools.

+ __JS Bin__ (https://jsbin.com/)

  JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Most of the examples that are in this course are on JSBin.

  Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as [this one](https://tinyurl.com/yxrpoqek)) or on YouTube. The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. And you can modify the examples as you like, you can also modify / clone / save / share them. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.

+ __CodePen__ (https://codepen.io/)

  CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real-time remote pair programming and teaching.

Here's an article of interest if you use CodePen: [Things you can do with CodePen](https://tinyurl.com/y2hmvmjn) [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].

There are many other handy tools such as [JSFiddle](https://tinyurl.com/gwvkoph), and [Dabblet](https://tinyurl.com/yxcsgho7). Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc.


### Browser compatibility

The term browser compatibility refers to the ability of a given Web site to appear fully functional on the browsers available in the market.

The most powerful aspect of the Web is what makes it so challenging to build for: its universality. When you create a Web site, you’re writing code that needs to be understood by many different browsers on different devices and operating systems!

To make the Web evolve in a sane and sustainable way for both users and developers, browser vendors work together to standardize new features, whether it’s a new [HTML element](https://tinyurl.com/l69mahr), [CSS property](https://tinyurl.com/y44pjn6o), or [JavaScript API](https://tinyurl.com/m3r6r7c). But different vendors have different priorities, resources, and release cycles — so it’s very unlikely that a new feature will land on all the major browsers at once. As a Web developer, this is something you must consider if you’re relying on a feature to build your site.

We are then providing references to the browser support of HTML5 features presented in this course using 2 resources: [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) and [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://tinyurl.com/32h8nkt).


#### Can I use

[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) provides up-to-date tables for support of front-end Web technologies on desktop and mobile Web browsers. Below is a snapshot of what information is given by CanIUse when searching for "CSS3 colors".

![Example of a CanIUse browser support table (using CSS3 colors)](https://tinyurl.com/y5a6vjr6)


#### MDN Web Docs

To help developers make these decisions consciously rather than accidentally, [MDN Web Docs](https://tinyurl.com/d8cpwq) provides browser compatibility tables in its documentation pages, so that when looking up a feature you’re considering for your project, you know exactly which browsers will support it.


#### External resources:

+ [MDN browser compatibility data: Taking the guesswork out of web compatibility](https://tinyurl.com/ss7hmrl)
+ [Caniuse and MDN compatibility data collaboration](https://tinyurl.com/yyrmzxdk)


### W3C validators

For over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting [__free__ and __open source__ tools](https://w3c.github.io/developers/) used every day by __millions of Web developers and Web designers__. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the [W3C Developers tools](https://tinyurl.com/y2duo6dg) site.


#### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks the [markup validity](https://tinyurl.com/jhupheb) of various Web document formats, such as HTML. Note that you are automatically directed to the [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) when validating an HTML5 document.


#### CSS Validator

The [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.


#### Unicorn

[Unicorn](https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/) is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.


#### Internationalization Checker

The [W3C Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.


#### Link Checker

The [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink) looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid [(X)HTML Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


### W3C cheatsheet

The [W3C cheatsheet](https://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/) provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.


<div style="margin: 0.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-flow: row wrap;">
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/" ismap target="_blank">
    <img src="img/00-01_W3Ccheatsheet.png" style="margin: 0.1em;" alt="W3C Cheatsheet snapshot image" title="W3C Cheatsheet snapshot image" width=350>
  </a>
</div>


Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.

The W3C cheatsheet is only available as a [pure Web application](https://tinyurl.com/yym4a4t2).


### Help build the Web platform

Most of the technologies you use when developing Web applications and Web sites are designed and standardized in W3C in a completely open and transparent process.

In fact, all W3C specifications are developed in public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/w3c/), so if you are familiar with GitHub, you already know how to contribute to W3C specifications! This is all about raising issues (with feedback and suggestions) and/or bringing pull requests to fix identified issues.


#### Contribute

Contributing to this standardization process might be a bit scary or hard to approach at first, but understanding at a deeper level how these technologies are built is a great way to build your expertise.

If you're looking to an easy way to dive into this standardization processes, check out which issues in the [W3C GitHub repositories](https://tinyurl.com/y5dyzcmy) have been marked as "good first issue" and see if you find anything where you think you would be ready to help.


#### Shape the future

Another approach is to go and bring feedback on ideas for future technologies: [the W3C Web Platform Community Incubator Group](https://wicg.io/) was built as an easy place to get started to provide feedback on new proposals or bring brand-new proposals for consideration.

Happy Web building!


## About W3C and the Web


### What is W3C?

__As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.__

W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.


#### A few history bits

[Tim Berners-Lee](https://tinyurl.com/yytm8n5y) wrote a [proposal](https://tinyurl.com/hafv55w) in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then created the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in collaboration with [CERN](https://home.cern/), where the Web originated (see information on the [original CERN Server](https://www.w3.org/Daemon/)), with support from DARPA and the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm).

In April 1995, [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/) became the first European W3C host, followed by [Keio University of Japan](https://www.keio.ac.jp/) (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, [ERCIM](https://www.ercim.eu/) took over the role of European W3C Host from Inria. In 2013, W3C announced [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) as the fourth Host.

In addition to these four Host locations that employ W3C staff, there are [W3C Offices](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Offices/staff) around the globe that support the developer communities in their regions and organize local events. Find the one next to your place!


#### A few figures

As of June 2020, W3C:

+ Is a [member](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List)-driven organization composed of nearly 430 companies, universities, start-ups, etc. from all over the world.
+ Holds 44 [technical groups](https://www.w3.org/groups/), including Working and Interest Groups where technical specifications are discussed and developed.
+ Published over 7,181 [published technical reports](https://www.w3.org/TR/), including 430 Web standards (or W3C Recommendations) - since January 1st,1995.
+ Runs a [translation program](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/) to foster the translation of its specifications: see the [translation matrix](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/matrix.html) currently listing 304 available translations of W3C recommendations.
+ Hosts 337 [Community and Business Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/), where developers, designers, and anyone passionate about the Web have a place to hold discussions and publish ideas.
+ Gathers over 12,912 active participants constituting the W3C community.
+ Has a [technical staff](https://www.w3.org/People/) composed of 64 people, spread on all five continents.


### The Web is amazing!

People often use the words "Internet" and "Web" interchangeably, but this usage is technically incorrect.

The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are e-mail and ftp for example. One analogy equates the Internet to a road network where the Web is a car, the email is a bicycle, etc.  Read this article for more details about the difference between Internet and the Web.

The W3C community is passionate about creating free and open Web standards. The next video, created in partnership with Microsoft, explains why standards are important to maintain a royalty-free, Open Web Platform, as well as to help shape the Web of the future.

### Quizzes

1. What is the difference between Internet and Web?

  a. Internet and Web are the same thing<br/>
  b. Internet is a network of networks<br/>
  c. Web is an application of Internet<br/>
  
  Ans: bc<br/>
  Explanation:
    + The Internet is technically a network of a wide variety of networks. From the Wikipedia's definition: "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."
    + The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are e-mail and ftp for example.
    + A precise definition of the Web is to be found in the "W3C's Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume I" document: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."
  

2. What is the difference between HTML and HTTP?

  a. HTTP describes what's on the page and HTML allows sites to communicate with each other<br/>
  b. HTML describes what's on a page and HTTP allows the page to be communicated to a user<br/>
  c. HTML and HTTP are the same thing<br/>

  Ans: b<br/>
  Explanation: HTTP precisely stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol", and HTML is "HyperText Markup Language". It may be easy to confuse HTTP and HTML since they both have the word HyperText in their names! But, HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext (text using hyperlinks) between nodes, while HTML is the standard markup language used to create Web pages.


### Why accessibility is important

> The power of the Web is in its universality.<br/>
> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.<br/>
> __Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web__

The Web has become an essential aspect of our daily lives, and everyone should have access to this technology. Web accessibility focuses on ensuring equivalent access for people with disabilities. It is increasingly important to many organizations and governments from around the world, and has many business benefits. Access to information, including on the Web, is also recognized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).


#### Who is impacted?

Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing, learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:

+ Captions on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of hearing;
+ Clear and consistent layout for people with learning and cognitive disabilities;
+ Keyboard support for people with physical disabilities and who do not use a mouse;
+ Text alternatives for people with visual disabilities and who are using screen readers;


#### Web accessibility benefits people with and _without_ disabilities

Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:

+ People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
+ People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
+ People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
+ People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own Web site;
+ People who are not fluent in the language of your particular Web site;

The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. More information is available in the [W3C Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) overview.


### First steps in Web accessibility

There are many simple Web accessibility improvements that you can implement and check right away, even when you are new to this topic.

Remember that when developing or redesigning a website or Web application, it is best to evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them.

Two examples are provided below  but you can find more tips and information in these 2 resources:

+ [Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/)
+ [Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)


#### Example #1: page title

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the Web page markup, they are the words `<title>` within the `<head>`.

__Check #1: There is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of a page, and it distinguishes the page from other Web pages.__

Example:

```html
<head>
...
<title>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page</title>
...
</head>
```


#### Example 2: image text alternatives ("alt text")

Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.

__Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.__

Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.

```html
<a href="https://w3.org">
<img src="https://w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png" width="72" height="48" alt="World Wide Web Consortium">
</a>
```


### HTML5 and accessibility

What you will learn in this course about accessibility:

+ Master best practices for creating accessible Web pages that use the HTML5 structuring elements
+ Learn tips on which accessible multimedia players to use
+ Have a peek of the work in progress in the canvas, concerning accessibility
+ Make accessible forms

To find out more about digital accessibility, please follow W3C's  “[Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://tinyurl.com/y6ly7e5z)” course. It provides a strong foundation for making Web sites and apps work well for people with disabilities, meet international standards, and enhance the user experience for all web users. It is designed for technical and non-technical audiences, including: developers, designers, content authors, project managers, people with disabilities, and many others.

Based on the [open curricula](https://www.w3.org/WAI/curricula/) from the Education and Outreach Working Group ([EOWG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/eowg/)) of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)), this course brings together international expert trainers from [Deque](https://www.deque.com/), [Infoaxia](https://infoaxia.co.jp/%20target=), [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/%20target=), [Knowbility](https://knowbility.org/), The Paciello Group ([TPG](https://www.paciellogroup.com/)), and [Web Key IT](https://www.webkeyit.com/).



### Why internationalization is important

Access to the Web for all has been a fundamental concern and goal of the W3C since the beginning. It is easy to overlook the needs of people from cultures different to your own, or who use different languages or writing systems, but you have to ensure that any content or application that you design or develop is ready to support the international features that they will need.

'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' and the 'n'. We also use 'Webi18n' to shorten "Web Internationalization" ;)

The [W3C Internationalization Activity](https://www.w3.org/International/) works with W3C working groups and liaises with other organizations to make it possible to use Web technologies with different languages, scripts, and cultures.

During this course you will learn about some basic internationalization features, such as character encoding and language declarations. If you don't use those features you will create barriers for people from different cultures who are trying to access your content. This is important even if you think you are only designing for a specific community – communities are made up of diverse individuals, and the Web stretches worldwide.


#### Unicode

Text in a computer or on the Web is composed of characters. Characters represent letters of the alphabet, punctuation, or other symbols.

Unicode is a universal character set, ie. a standard that defines, in one place, all the characters needed for writing languages in use on computers. It is a superset of all other character sets that have been encoded.

As a content author or developer, It is important to clearly distinguish between the concepts of a character set versus a character encoding. You should nowadays always [choose the UTF-8 character encoding](https://tinyurl.com/y6d2o58e) for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single encoding to handle any character you are likely to meet. This greatly simplifies things.


### Essential steps in Web i18n

You find below three examples (and checks!) to help you to ensure that your Web page works for people around the world, and to make it work differently for different cultures, where needed. Let's meet the words 'charset' and 'lang', soon to become your favorite markup ;)


#### Example 1: Character encoding declaration

A character encoding declaration is vital to ensure that the text in your page is recognized by browsers around the world, and not garbled. You will learn more about what this is, and how to use it as you work through the course. For now, just ensure that it's always there.

__Check #1: There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and its value is UTF-8.__

Example 1:

```html
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>
```


#### Example 2: Primary language declaration

For a wide variety of reasons, it's important for a browser to know what language your page is written in, including font selection, text-to-speech conversion, spell-checking, hyphenation and automated line breaking, text transforms, automated translation, and more. _You should always indicate the primary language of your page in the `<html>` tag._ Again you will learn how to do this during the course. You will also learn how to change the language, where necessary, for parts of your document that are in a different language.

__Check #2: The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.__

Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
...
```


#### Example 3: Cultural bias

People around the world don't always understand cultural references that you are familiar with, for example the concept of a 'home run' in baseball, or a particular type of food. You should be careful when using examples to illustrate ideas. Also, people in other cultures don't necessarily identify with pictures that you would recognize, for example, hand gestures can have quite unexpected meanings in other parts of the world, and photos of people in a group may not be representative of populations elsewhere. When creating forms for capturing personal details, you will quickly find that your assumptions about how personal names and addresses work are very different from those of people from other cultures.

__Check #3: If your content will be seen by people from diverse cultures, check that your cultural references will be recognized and that there is no inappropriate cultural bias.__


#### Don't worry!

You will learn about the basics as you progress through the course, so don't worry about things you don't understand on this page – you'll learn about them shortly. Once you have taken the course, you can find more tips and information from the W3C at: [Internationalization techniques: Authoring HTML & CSS](https://tinyurl.com/y3dmq9r4).

When you start creating Web pages, you can also run them through the W3C's [Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/). If there are internationalization problems with your page, this checker explains what they are and what to do about it.
