### Getting around the course

If you're new to edX here is some information to get you started.

You are also welcome to register to [DemoX](https://www.edx.org/course/demox), which is a fun and interactive edX course designed to help you explore the edX learning experience.


#### Layout of the course

This course is composed of 6 weeks/modules. Each module is made of units which goes over all the material you need to learn for the module 's topic. To navigate through the module 's units, use the navigation bar at the top. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each unit generally has some video content, reading material, an activity, and one or two questions to test your knowledge. Those questions are called "_knowledge checks_". The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the exercises (and the final exam!) that is the end of each module, you should learn the material in all the units.


#### Bookmarks

You can bookmark one or more pages (up to 100), i.e., to mark course content so that you can come back to it later (see image below). Please read the [related documentation](https://tinyurl.com/y5kzc6sf).


#### Progress indicators or check marks

You will notice that green check marks appear when you complete content on the unit level and the subsection level. A "completed" unit is a unit where the learner has answered every problem, watched every video all the way through, and viewed the unit page for at least five seconds.

These check marks are intended as a way for you to keep track of your progress through the course, and __they do not impact grades, course completion, or the ability to earn a certificate__. Read [this documentation](https://tinyurl.com/y2q6sevt) to find more.


#### Instructor feedback

Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the __discussion boards (or forums)__. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.


__Note__: If you wish to share your HTML code in the discussions, you can paste your code directly in a discussion forum post (highlight code and Ctrl+K/use the code widget) or use one of the following online code editors:

+ JS Bin: https://jsbin.com ([JS Bin tutorial](https://tinyurl.com/yxrpoqek))
+ CodePen: https://codepen.io ([CodePen tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/112-using-codepen/))

These are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactive online code editors that preview/showcase your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real time remote pair programming.

## Course forums


### Course forums

This course provides discussion forums. Forums are available at the end of most course subsections, so you create posts on the topic being discussed in a particular subsection. You are free to use the forums to connect with other students.

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post as either a question or a discussion. When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question or a discussion.

+ A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion administration team and the course community can provide answers -- a question mark image identifies posts that ask questions
+ A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections, and inviting community participation.
As shown on the right, a question mark icon "?" identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation bubble image identifies posts that start discussions.

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, select __Discussion__ at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop- down list. (All __Discussions__ is selected by default.) Only posts about the topic you select appear in the list of posts.

You are free to use the forums to connect with other students and the instructor, as well as ask questions about the material. Note that you will find an existing thread dedicated to student introductions.

In addition, students will have a varied level of experience with the technologies covered in this course, so questions will range from the very basic to the very advanced. You are encouraged to assist other students and share your experiences with the product. Thanks a lot!

Find out more about [discussion forums](https://tinyurl.com/y69qq39p) in the edX Help Center.

edX is a global platform: as such, when creating posts, please be respectful of all cultures, creeds and religions.


### Discussion forum best practices

Below are guidelines and best practices for productive collaboration and discussion in our course.

+ __Participate!__ It will enhance your learning experience and some discussions may be subject to examination.
+ __Help each other!__ We encourage you to reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
+ __Be polite!__ Opinions are good, but please respect others’ opinions as well.
+ __Do not cheat!__ See collaboration guidelines below to see what’s acceptable.


#### Collaboration guidelines

These will help you use the forum appropriately as an aid to learning the material. We encourage you to:

+ Discuss the general approach to solving a problem.
+ Share your work results (following proposed activities or other).
+ Work jointly to come up with the steps for a solution, or to create an original work.
+ Ask for a hint or clarification in the discussion board, or several hints for that matter, if you get stuck while solving a problem.
+ Please search (use the search button) for an answer to your question in the discussion board before posting. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions and you may find the question and answer without needing to post it yourself.

It is NOT ok to:

+ Post the solution to a problem in the discussion board or somewhere else on the Web. If you need help, post errors you’re encountering, but not your answers.
+ Take someone else's solution and simply copy the answers from their solution.

These actions are considered to be cheating. Violations of these guidelines may result in posts being deleted or your account being deactivated.


#### Guidelines to navigate and interact on the forum

The discussion forum helps improve your ability to search and talk about many different topics throughout the course. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ At the end of some pages, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Use a descriptive and specific title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners having the same issue.
+ Use “netiquette,” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
  + Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
  + Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).
  + Avoid repeating letters or characters like this: reeepeeaattingggg chaaracterrrss
  + Avoid excessive punctuation if possible (e.g. !!!!!!!! or ??????)
  + It’s fine to make suggestions, but avoid negative commentary and please do not “flame” anyone.



## Course tools

### Web browsers

Not surprisingly, it would be helpful to have a browser (short for "Web Browser") installed so that you can see the end result of your source code.

Most common browsers for the desktop are Microsoft Edge (and IE), Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Brave, etc.

Look for the [history of Web browsers](https://tinyurl.com/yyp4lo2c) (on Wikipedia). An interesting resource is the [Browser and Platform Market Share](https://tinyurl.com/zk7er8v) (updated regularly).


#### Viewing your work

There are a couple of easy ways you can use a browser to view your work.

First, you open the file in your browser. Typically, if you navigate to an html file and open it, the system will open it with a browser by default.


### Web editors

While any text editor, like NotePad or TextEdit, can be used to create Web pages, they don't necessarily offer a lot of help towards that end. Other options offer more facilities for error checking, syntax coloring and saving some typing by filling things out for you.

Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:

+ [Notepad](https://tinyurl.com/kfhnndv) - on Windows PC's
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://tinyurl.com/ortxxge) - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
+ [XCode](https://tinyurl.com/5r4auez) - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
+ TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're [saving as plain text](https://tinyurl.com/y4ww4m64), not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
+ [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
+ [BlueGriffon](http://bluegriffon.org/) - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
+ [Atom](https://atom.io/) - another cross platform editor, created by [GitHub](https://github.com/).
+ [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) - great editors on which the Internet was built, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.


### Online editors

To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, we use the following interactive online editors. Pretty much all the course's examples actually use these tools.

+ __JS Bin__ (https://jsbin.com/)

  JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Most of the examples that are in this course are on JSBin.

  Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as [this one](https://tinyurl.com/yxrpoqek)) or on YouTube. The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. And you can modify the examples as you like, you can also modify / clone / save / share them. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.

+ __CodePen__ (https://codepen.io/)

  CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real-time remote pair programming and teaching.

Here's an article of interest if you use CodePen: [Things you can do with CodePen](https://tinyurl.com/y2hmvmjn) [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].

There are many other handy tools such as [JSFiddle](https://tinyurl.com/gwvkoph), and [Dabblet](https://tinyurl.com/yxcsgho7). Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc.


### Browser compatibility

The term browser compatibility refers to the ability of a given Web site to appear fully functional on the browsers available in the market.

The most powerful aspect of the Web is what makes it so challenging to build for: its universality. When you create a Web site, you’re writing code that needs to be understood by many different browsers on different devices and operating systems!

To make the Web evolve in a sane and sustainable way for both users and developers, browser vendors work together to standardize new features, whether it’s a new [HTML element](https://tinyurl.com/l69mahr), [CSS property](https://tinyurl.com/y44pjn6o), or [JavaScript API](https://tinyurl.com/m3r6r7c). But different vendors have different priorities, resources, and release cycles — so it’s very unlikely that a new feature will land on all the major browsers at once. As a Web developer, this is something you must consider if you’re relying on a feature to build your site.

We are then providing references to the browser support of HTML5 features presented in this course using 2 resources: [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) and [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://tinyurl.com/32h8nkt).


#### Can I use

[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) provides up-to-date tables for support of front-end Web technologies on desktop and mobile Web browsers. Below is a snapshot of what information is given by CanIUse when searching for "CSS3 colors".

![Example of a CanIUse browser support table (using CSS3 colors)](https://tinyurl.com/y5a6vjr6)


#### MDN Web Docs

To help developers make these decisions consciously rather than accidentally, [MDN Web Docs](https://tinyurl.com/d8cpwq) provides browser compatibility tables in its documentation pages, so that when looking up a feature you’re considering for your project, you know exactly which browsers will support it.


#### External resources:

+ [MDN browser compatibility data: Taking the guesswork out of web compatibility](https://tinyurl.com/ss7hmrl)
+ [Caniuse and MDN compatibility data collaboration](https://tinyurl.com/yyrmzxdk)


### W3C validators

For over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting [__free__ and __open source__ tools](https://w3c.github.io/developers/) used every day by __millions of Web developers and Web designers__. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the [W3C Developers tools](https://tinyurl.com/y2duo6dg) site.


#### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks the [markup validity](https://tinyurl.com/jhupheb) of various Web document formats, such as HTML. Note that you are automatically directed to the [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) when validating an HTML5 document.


#### CSS Validator

The [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.


#### Unicorn

[Unicorn](https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/) is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.


#### Internationalization Checker

The [W3C Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.


#### Link Checker

The [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink) looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid [(X)HTML Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).


### W3C cheatsheet

The [W3C cheatsheet](https://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/) provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.


<div style="margin: 0.5em; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-flow: row wrap;">
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/" ismap target="_blank">
    <img src="img/00-01_W3Ccheatsheet.png" style="margin: 0.1em;" alt="W3C Cheatsheet snapshot image" title="W3C Cheatsheet snapshot image" width=350>
  </a>
</div>


Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.

The W3C cheatsheet is only available as a [pure Web application](https://tinyurl.com/yym4a4t2).


### Help build the Web platform

Most of the technologies you use when developing Web applications and Web sites are designed and standardized in W3C in a completely open and transparent process.

In fact, all W3C specifications are developed in public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/w3c/), so if you are familiar with GitHub, you already know how to contribute to W3C specifications! This is all about raising issues (with feedback and suggestions) and/or bringing pull requests to fix identified issues.


#### Contribute

Contributing to this standardization process might be a bit scary or hard to approach at first, but understanding at a deeper level how these technologies are built is a great way to build your expertise.

If you're looking to an easy way to dive into this standardization processes, check out which issues in the [W3C GitHub repositories](https://tinyurl.com/y5dyzcmy) have been marked as "good first issue" and see if you find anything where you think you would be ready to help.


#### Shape the future

Logo of the W3C Web Incubator Community GroupAnother approach is to go and bring feedback on ideas for future technologies: [the W3C Web Platform Community Incubator Group](https://wicg.io/) was built as an easy place to get started to provide feedback on new proposals or bring brand-new proposals for consideration.

Happy Web building!
