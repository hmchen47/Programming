### 5.3.1 Accessible forms

Forms are commonly used to enable user interaction in Web sites and Web applications. For example, they are used for login, registering, commenting, and purchasing.

Since HTML5 provides functionalities to assist with accessibility, developers should make a concerted effort to mark up Web based forms. The following two guidelines are to give you a good start to make your forms accessible:

1. For every form field, ensure that a descriptive __label__ is provided and use the `<label> `element to identify each form control.
2. For larger or complex forms, use the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements to respectively __group and associate__ related form controls.

Examples for each of these two basic guidelines are given in the following pages.
