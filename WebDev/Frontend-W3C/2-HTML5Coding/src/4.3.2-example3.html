This example shows how to handle key events in a canvas by adding a key listener to the canvas object (see the blue border around the canvas... it shows that the canvas has the focus. Try to click outside of the canvas: it will loose the focus).
<p>
  If you don't want a border to appear when you click on the canvas, set its style to outline: none
  </p>
  <p>Press a key when the canvas has the focus: an alert will display the keycode of the key you pressed. Problem: if the canvas looses the focus, key press are no more detected...</p>

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="350" tabindex="1" height="200">
</canvas>

<script>
  var canvas;
  
  function init() {
 canvas=document.getElementById('myCanvas');

    // This will work only if the canvas has the focus 
    canvas.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown, false);
    
    // We can set the focus on the canvas like that:
     //canvas.focus();
    
    // ... but it will stop working if we click somewhere else
    // in the document
  }


  function handleKeydown(e){
     alert('keycode: '+e.keyCode);
     return false;
  };
