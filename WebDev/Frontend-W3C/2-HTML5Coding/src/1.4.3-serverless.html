  <summary>What is this?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>A demo of the HTML5 <code>download</code> attribute.
    When used on an anchor, this attribute signifies that the resource it points to should be downloaded
    by the browser rather than navigating to it.</p>
    <p>'Create file' creates a .txt file from the <code>contenteditable</code> region's content. This is done
    by using <code>window.URL.createObjectURL()</code>. That generated file can be named and saved to
    the user's machine by setting the  <code>download</code> attribute on a link.</p>
    <p><b>Browser support</b>: right now, only Chrome dev channel (14.0.835.15+) supports this attribute.</p>

Telling the browser to <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_com/images/srpr/logo2w.png" download="MyGLogo">download it</a>.</h1>
