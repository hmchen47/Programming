### 6.1.2 HTML5 JavaScript APIs

We have already studied some of the HTML5 JavaScript APIs, including:

+ The canvas API,
+ The form validation API,
+ The audio and video elements API, the getUserMedia API (also related to audio and video elements),

However, HTML5 also comes with several APIs that are not directly related to HTML elements, namely: the Orientation API; the Geolocation API; most APIs related to client-side persistence; the Web Storage API; the Web Workers API; and some other APIs that are not in the HTML5 specification, but are related to it, such as the GamePad API, the Web Audio API, etc.

This week, we will look at some of the most useful APIs. Others will be covered in the [W3C HTML5 Apps and Games course](https://www.edx.org/course/html5-apps-and-games):

+ __The "Web Storage" API, sort of "super cookies", for storing pairs of key/values client side.__ This API is useful for enabling Web sites to save/restore their state, or for writing serverless applications. You will see a small contact manager that stores its data locally, without the need for a remote Web server.
+ __The File API, that enables Web applications to work with local files.__ For example, a picture editor, or media player that can work with your music and video files - the ones on your phone or your hard disk! With this API you will also be able to preview image files directly in your page - there is no need to send them to a remote server.
+ __you are here signThe Geolocation API for obtaining data such as longitude, latitude, altitude (when available), and speed.__ You will learn how to write applications in combination with interactive maps. You will also learn how to guess the address of a user, for example for pre-filling a registration form with the city, country, and zip code that corresponds with the current location.

Happy learning!
