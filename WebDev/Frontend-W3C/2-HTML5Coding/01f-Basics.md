## 1.2 Quizes

### 1.2.1 Greater simplicity (1-2)

1. Towards more simplicity

  HTML5 has a relaxed syntax compared to previous versions. One of these statements is incorrect - which one?

  a. `<link rel='stylesheet' href=style.css>`<br/>
  b. `<textarea rows=20 cols="80">Hello...</textarea>`<br/>
  c. `<img src=myImage.jpg width=200 height=400>`<br/>
  d. `<img src=Michel Buffa.jpg ></img>`<br/>
  e. `<link rel=stylesheet href=style.css>`<br/>

  Ans: d <br/>
  Exmplanation: HTML5 quotes are optional if an attribute value does not contain any spaces. All answers are correct except answer 4, as Michel Buffa contains a space, so in that case the correct value should have been "Michel Buffa.jpg" or 'Michel Buffa.jpg'


2. Doctype definition

  With HTML5, please select how to declare the DOCTYPE of an element:

  a. You need to declare `<!DOCTYPE html>` in order to have a valid document<br/>
  b. No need to declare any DOCTYPE, the document will be valid anyway<br/>
  c. All HTML4.01 and XHTML DOCTYPE definitions can be used<br/>
  
  Ans: a <br/>
  Explanation: There is only one simplified way to declare the DOCTYPE. The DOCTYPE must be declared in order to have a valid document.
