      "class SequenceMatcher(builtins.object)\n",
      " |  SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of\n",
      " |  any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic\n",
      " |  algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm\n",
      " |  published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the\n",
      " |  hyperbolic name \"gestalt pattern matching\".  The basic idea is to find\n",
      " |  the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no \"junk\"\n",
      " |  elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied\n",
      " |  recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right\n",
      " |  of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit\n",
      " |  sequences, but does tend to yield matches that \"look right\" to people.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  SequenceMatcher tries to compute a \"human-friendly diff\" between two\n",
      " |  sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the\n",
      " |  longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what\n",
      " |  catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting\n",
      " |  notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.\n",
      " |  That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference\n",
      " |  reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable\n",
      " |  to synching up on blocks of \"junk lines\", though (like blank lines in\n",
      " |  ordinary text files, or maybe \"<P>\" lines in HTML files).  That may be\n",
      " |  because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of\n",
      " |  \"junk\" <wink>.\n",
      " |  \n",
