    of subjects as given in subjectSizes, using the subjects as loaded
    from filename. Choose a random subject of subjects for each trial.
    For instance, if subjectSizes is the list [10, 20, 30], then you should
    first select 10 random subjects from the loaded subjects, then run them
    through the three advisors using maxWork for numRuns times, measuring
    the time taken for each run, then average over the numRuns runs. After that,
    pick another set of 20 random subjects from the loaded subjects,

    with the x-axis showing number of subjects used, and y-axis showing
    time. Be sure you label your plots.

    What trend do you observe among the three advisors?
    How does the time taken to pick subjects grow as the number of subject
    used increases? Why do you think that is the case? Include the answers
    to these questions in your writeup.
    
    Answer: The time taken by the Brute Force advisor grows exponentially
    as the number of subjects increases, while the other two grow roughly
    linearly, with Dynamic Programming being more than Greedy by
    a multiplicative factor. This makes sense since the greedy algorithm
    is roughly O(n log n) where n is the length of the subject list,
    brute force is exponential with O(2^n) where, and dynamic programming
    is somewhere in between.
