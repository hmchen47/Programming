   Allows the user to play the given hand, as follows:
 
   * The hand is displayed.
   * The user may input a word or a single period (the string ".")
     to indicate they're done playing
   * Invalid words are rejected, and a message is displayed asking
     the user to choose another word until they enter a valid word or "."
   * When a valid word is entered, it uses up letters from the hand.
   * After every valid word: the score for that word is displayed,
     the remaining letters in the hand are displayed, and the user
     is asked to input another word.
   * The sum of the word scores is displayed when the hand finishes.
   * The hand finishes when there are no more unused letters or the user
