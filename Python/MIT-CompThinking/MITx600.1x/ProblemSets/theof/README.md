                                          HELLO EVERYONE !!!!!

This is a repo dedicated to help those who are taking MIT's edX course : 6.00.1x-Introduction to Computer Science and Programming! I will be adding frequently the code needed for the problem sets! I encourage you to read the code many times till you fully understand it and not blindly copy and paste it! Any comments or suggestions are all welcome!!!
