Problem Set 7
=============
Introduction
------------
INTRODUCTION

In problem set 7, you will build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet. Your program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user's interests (for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted).

This problem set has a lot of words, but don't get intimidated! The staff solution has about 80 lines of code; we recommend that the solutions you write for each problem should stay under about 15-20 lines of code (the solutions for some problems will be much shorter than that). If you find yourself writing way more code than that, you should ask for help on the discussion forum and look into alternative ways of implementing things in a simpler way.

We recommend starting early because there is a lot of reading here, but you ought to be able to do this problem set sequentially in the order that we've laid out. There are a lot of references on Python classes available (look for classes in the readings listed in the Reference Links section of the webpage); here is the official Python tutorial (http://goo.gl/W3IR59) on classes, sections 9.1-9.7 (excepting 9.5.1) will be useful for this pset.

OBJECTIVES

The goal of this problem set is to help you become familiar and comfortable with the following topics:
* Many facets of object oriented programming, specifically:
    - Implementing new classes and their attributes. (http://goo.gl/MGKrba)
    - Understanding class methods. (http://goo.gl/S3W9BT)
    - Understanding inheritance. (http://goo.gl/Ojvnaa)
    - Telling the difference between a class and an instance of that class - recall that a class is a blueprint of an object, whilst an instance is a single, unique unit of a class.
* Utilizing libraries as black boxes.

RSS OVERVIEW

Many websites have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule. News sites, such as Google News (http://news.google.com/), are a good example of this. One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in your browser, and periodically hit the refresh button. Fortunately, this process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS feed, using an RSS feed reader instead of a web browser (e.g. Sage [https://goo.gl/nXzTcN]). An RSS reader will periodically collect and draw your attention to updated content.

RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing) data stored in an XML-format file residing on a web-server. For this project the details are unimportant. You don't need to know what XML is, nor do you need to know how to access these files over the network.

We will use a special Python module to deal with these low-level details. The higher-level details of the structure of the Google News RSS feed as described on the next page should be enough for our purposes. 

Conflict with Grader
To avoid getting an error from the grader about using the class variables title, subject, or summary, rename any variable you have used with these names to something else. Thank you!

PART 1: DATA STRUCTURE DESIGN
-----------------------------
First, let's talk about one specific RSS feed: Google News. The URL for the Google News feed is: http://news.google.com/?output=rss

If you try to load this URL in your browser, you'll probably see your browser's interpretation of the XML code generated by the feed. You can view the XML source with your browser's "View Page Source" function, though it probably will not make much sense to you. Abstractly, whenever you connect to the Google News RSS feed, you receive a list of items. Each entry in this list represents a single news item. In a Google News feed, every entry has the following fields:
    guid : A globally unique identifier for this news story.
    title : The news story's headline.
    subject : A subject tag for this story (e.g. 'Top Stories', or 'Sports').
    summary : A paragraph or so summarizing the news story.
    link : A link to a web-site with the entire story.

Generalizing the Problem
This is a little trickier than we'd like it to be, because each of these RSS feeds is structured a little bit differently than the others. So, our goal in Part I is to come up with a unified, standard representation that we'll use to store a news story.

Why do we want this? When all is said and done, we want an application that aggregates several RSS feeds from various sources and can act on all of them in the exact same way: we should be able to read news stories from various RSS feeds all in one place. If you've ever used an RSS feed reader, be assured that it has had to solve the exact problem we're going to tackle in this pset!

PROBLEM 1
Parsing is the process of turning a data stream into a structured format that is more convenient to work with. We have provided you with code that will retrieve and parse the Google and Yahoo news feeds.

Parsing all of this information from the feeds that Google/Yahoo/the New York Times/etc. gives us is no small feat. So, let's tackle an easy part of the problem first: Pretend that someone has already done the specific parsing, and has left you with variables that contain the following information for a news story:

globally unique identifier (GUID) - a string that serves as a unique name for this entry
    title - a string
    subject - a string
    summary - a string
    link to more content - a string

We want to store this information in an object that we can then pass around in the rest of our program. Your task, in this problem, is to write a class, NewsStory, starting with a constructor that takes (guid, title, subject, summary, link) as arguments and stores them appropriately. NewsStory also needs to contain the following methods:
    getGuid(self)
    getTitle(self)
    getSubject(self)
    getSummary(self)
    getLink(self)

Each method should return the appropriate element of an instance. For example, if we have implemented the class and call
    test = NewsStory('foo', 'myTitle', 'mySubject', 'some long summary', 'www.example.com')
    then test.getGuid() will return foo.

The solution to this problem should be relatively short and very straightforward (please review what get methods should do if you find yourself writing multiple lines of code for each). Once you have implemented NewsStory all the NewsStory test cases should work.

To test your class definition, we have provided a test suite in ps7_test.py. You can test your code by loading and running this file. You should see an "OK" for the NewsStory tests if your code is correct. Because ps7.py contains code to run the full RSS scraping system, we suggest you do not try to run ps7.py directly to test your implementation. Instead, in IDLE, you can do the following:
    >>> from ps7 import *
    >>> test = ps7.NewsStory('foo', 'myTitle', 'mySubject', 'some long summary', 'www.example.com')
    to load in then run your own tests on your class definitions.
    Canopy Specific Instructions: If you are getting an error, type the following instead:
    >>> cd [insert the full path of the directory where your code resides]
    >>> from ps7 import *
    >>> test = NewsStory('foo', 'myTitle', 'mySubject', 'some long summary', 'www.example.com')
 
PART 2: TRIGGERS (WORDTRIGGERS)
-------------------------------
Given a set of news stories, your program will generate alerts for a subset of those stories. Stories with alerts will be displayed to the user, and the other stories will be silently discarded. We will represent alerting rules as triggers. A trigger is a rule that is evaluated over a single news story and may fire to generate an alert. For example, a simple trigger could fire for every news story whose title contained the word "Microsoft". Another trigger may be set up to fire for all news stories where the summary contained the word "Boston". Finally, a more specific trigger could be set up to fire only when a news story contained both the words "Microsoft" and "Boston" in the summary.

In order to simplify our code, we will use object polymorphism. We will define a trigger interface and then implement a number of different classes that implement that trigger interface in different ways.

TRIGGER INTERFACE
Each trigger class you define should implement the following interface, either directly or transitively. It must implement the evaluate method that takes a news item (NewsStory object) as an input and returns True if an alert should be generated for that item. We will not directly use the implementation of the Trigger class, which is why it throws an exception should anyone attempt to use it

The class below implements the Trigger interface (you will not modify this). Any subclass that inherits from it will have an evaluate method. By default, they will use the evaluate method in Trigger, the superclass, unless they define their own evaluate function, which would then be used instead. If some subclass neglects to define its own evaluate() method, calls to it will go to Trigger.evaluate(), which fails (albeit cleanly) with the NotImplementedError exception:
    class Trigger(object):
        def evaluate(self, story):
            """
            Returns True if an alert should be generated
            for the given news item, or False otherwise.
            """
            raise NotImplementedError

We will define a number of classes that inherit from Trigger. In the figure below, Trigger is a superclass, which all other classes inherit from. The arrow from WordTrigger to Trigger means that WordTrigger inherits from Trigger - a WordTrigger is a Trigger . Note that other classes inherit from WordTrigger.

[Trigger Class Inheritance] (https://goo.gl/jX5Z9K)

WHOLE WORD TRIGGERS
Having a trigger that always fires isn't interesting; let's write some that are. A user may want to be alerted about news items that contain specific words. For instance, a simple trigger could fire for every news item whose title contains the word "Microsoft". In the following problems, you will create a WordTrigger abstract class and implement three classes that inherit from this class.

The trigger should fire when the whole word is present. For example, a trigger for "soft" should fire on:
    Koala bears are soft and cuddly.
    I prefer pillows that are soft.
    Soft drinks are great.
    Soft's the new pink!
    "Soft!" he exclaimed as he threw the football.

But should not fire on:
    Microsoft recently released the Windows 8 Consumer Preview.
    Downey makes my clothes the softest they can be!

This is a little tricky, especially the case with the apostrophe. For the purpose of your parsing, pretend that a space or any character in string.punctuation is a word separator. If you've never seen string.punctuation before, go to your interpreter and type:
    >>> import string
    >>> print string.punctuation
    Play around with this a bit to get comfortable with what it is. The split and replace methods of strings will almost certainly be helpful as you tackle this part.
    You may also find the string methods lower and/or upper useful for this problem.

PROBLEM 2
Implement a word trigger abstract class, WordTrigger. It should take in a string word as an argument to the class's constructor.

WordTrigger should be a subclass of Trigger. It has one new method, isWordIn, which takes in one string argument text. It returns True if the whole word word is present in text, False otherwise, as described in the above examples. This method should not be case-sensitive. Implement this method.

Hint
Because this is an abstract class, we will not be directly instantiating any WordTriggers. WordTrigger should inherit its evaluate method from Trigger. We do this because now we can create subclasses of WordTrigger that use its isWordIn method. In this way, it is much like the Trigger interface, except now actual code from this WordTrigger class is used in its subclasses.

PROBLEM 3
You are now ready to implement WordTrigger's three subclasses: TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, and SummaryTrigger.

Implement a word trigger class, TitleTrigger, that fires when a news item's title contains a given word. The word should be an argument to the class's constructor. This trigger should not be case-sensitive (it should treat "Intel" and "intel" as being equal).

For example, an instance of this type of trigger could be used to generate an alert whenever the word "Intel" occurred in the title of a news item. Another instance could generate an alert whenever the word "Microsoft" occurred in the title of an item.

Think carefully about what methods should be defined in TitleTrigger and what methods should be inherited from the superclass. This class can be implemented in as few as 3 lines code!

Hint
Once you've implemented TitleTrigger, the TitleTrigger unit tests in our test suite should pass. Run ps7_test.py to check.

Canopy specific instructions:Every time you modify code inps7.py go to
Run -> Restart Kernel (or hit the CTRL with the dot on your keyboard)
before running ps7_test.py. You have to do this every time you modify the fileps7.py and want to run the fileps7_test.py, otherwise changes to the former will not be incorporated in the latter.

PROBLEM 4
Implement a word trigger class, SubjectTrigger, that fires when a news item's subject contains a given word. The word should be an argument to the class's constructor. This trigger should not be case-sensitive.

Once you've implemented SubjectTrigger, the SubjectTrigger unit tests in our test suite should pass.

PROBLEM 5
Implement a word trigger class, SummaryTrigger, that fires when a news item's summary contains a given word. The word should be an argument to the class's constructor. This trigger should not be case-sensitive.

Once you've implemented SummaryTrigger, the SummaryTrigger unit tests in our test suite should pass.

A More Precise Description
A Trigger tells you if a certain NewsStory meets the user's search criteria. Its evaluate method returns True if the story is relevant, and False if the story isn't relevant. For example, a TitleTrigger's evaluate method should return True if it's searching for the word "Pig" in the title "Square Pig", because the word "Pig" is in that title. But it should return False if searching for "Pig" in the title "Polyhedral Animal" because the word "Pig" isn't in that title.

One of the principles of object-oriented programming is inheritance. If one class extends another class, then the child inherits everything the parent could do. In this case, Trigger is the superclass (i.e. parent) of all other Trigger classes. It contains methods that all Trigger objects should have, regardless of type. All Trigger objects should be able to evaluate a story; otherwise, it wouldn't be able to tell the user if the story was relevant.

WordTrigger is a type of Trigger that handles situations where the user is looking for just one word. The user can search for this word in the title, subject, or summary. This is why TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, and SummaryTrigger extend WordTrigger in the diagram of the class hierarchy. All WordTrigger objects should be able to remember the word they're looking for. You have to code the __init__ method in WordTrigger to add this functionality. All WordTrigger objects should also be able to check if the word they're looking for is in a certain piece of text. You have to code the isWordIn method in WordTrigger to do this.

The WordTrigger is never called upon but used to create the subclass triggers. TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, and SummaryTrigger are at the bottom of the class hierarchy. Above them are WordTrigger and Trigger. This means they can already do everything a Trigger or WordTrigger can do. They can remember which word they're looking for (from WordTrigger). They can check if that word is in a given string of text (from WordTrigger). They have an evaluate method (from Trigger), although it doesn't do anything yet.

Your job is to write each evaluate method (overriding the method from Trigger) to allow the specific types of triggers to search the part of the NewsStory they were designed for. An evaluate function is written for each of the subclasses which will call on the isWordIn function you write for the WordTrigger. Use the diagram included in the problem to help you conceptualize the sub and superclasses. Only the bottom row of Triggers will actually be called by your program.

PART 2: TRIGGERS (COMPOSITETRIGGERS) 
COMPOSITE TRIGGERS
------------------
So the triggers from the previous page are mildly interesting, but we want to do better: we want to 'compose' the earlier triggers, to set up more powerful alert rules. For instance, we may want to raise an alert only when both "google" and "stock" were present in the news item (an idea we can't express right now).

Note that these triggers are not word triggers and should not be subclasses of WordTrigger.

PROBLEM 6
Implement a NOT trigger (NotTrigger).

This trigger should produce its output by inverting the output of another trigger. The NOT trigger should take this other trigger as an argument to its constructor. (Why its constructor? Because we can't change what parameters evaluate takes in... that'd break our polymorphism). So, given a trigger T and a news item x, the output of the NOT trigger's evaluate method should be equivalent to not T.evaluate(x).

When this is done, the NotTrigger unit tests should pass.

Canopy specific instructions:Every time you modify code inps7.pygo to
Run -> Restart Kernel (or hit the CTRL with the dot on your keyboard)
before running ps7_test.py. You have to do this every time you modify the fileps7.pyand want to run the fileps7_test.py, otherwise changes to the former will not be incorporated in the latter.

PROBLEM 7
Implement an AND trigger (AndTrigger).

This trigger should take two triggers as arguments to its constructor, and should fire on a news story only if both of the inputted triggers would fire on that item.

When this is done, the AndTrigger unit tests should pass.

PROBLEM 8
Implement an OR trigger (OrTrigger).

This trigger should take two triggers as arguments to its constructor, and should fire if either one (or both) of its inputted triggers would fire on that item.

When this is done, the OrTrigger unit tests should pass.

Note: In addition to the three classes in this problem (NotTrigger, AndTrigger, and OrTrigger), please provide your definitions of WordTrigger and TitleTrigger in the following box.

PART 2: TRIGGERS (PHRASETRIGGERS)  (5 points possible)
PHRASE TRIGGERS
---------------
At this point, you have no way of writing a trigger that matches on "New York City" -- the only triggers you know how to write would be a trigger that would fire on "New" AND "York" AND "City" -- which also fires on the phrase "New students at York University love the city". It's time to fix this. Since here you're asking for an exact match, we will require that the cases match, but we'll be a little more flexible on word matching. So, "New York City" will match:
    New York City sees movie premiere
    In the heart of New York City's famous cafe
    New York Cityrandomtexttoproveapointhere
    but will not match:
    I love new york city
    I love    New                 York                  City!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PROBLEM 9
Implement a phrase trigger (PhraseTrigger) that fires when a given phrase is in any of the story's subject, title, or summary. The phrase should be an argument to the class's constructor. You may find the Python operator in helpful, as in:
    >>> print "New York City" in "In the heart of New York City's famous cafe"
    True
    >>> print "New York City" in "I love new york city"
    False
    When this is done, the PhraseTrigger unit tests should pass.

Canopy specific instructions:Every time you modify code inps7.py go to
Run -> Restart Kernel (or hit the CTRL with the dot on your keyboard)
before running ps7_test.py. You have to do this every time you modify the fileps7.py and want to run the fileps7_test.py, otherwise changes to the former will not be incorporated in the latter.

Note: In addition to the class in this problem (PhraseTrigger), please provide your definitions of WordTrigger, TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, and SummaryTrigger in the following box.

PART 3: FILTERING
-----------------
At this point, you can run ps7.py, and it will fetch and display Google and Yahoo news items for you in little pop-up windows. How many news items? All of them.

Right now, the code we've given you in ps7.py gets all of the feeds every minute, and displays the result. This is nice, but, remember, the goal here was to filter out only the the stories we wanted.

PROBLEM 10
Write a function, filterStories(stories, triggerlist) that takes in a list of news stories and a list of triggers, and returns a list of only the stories for which any of the triggers fires on. The list of stories should be unique - that is, do not include any duplicates in the list. For example, if 2 triggers fire on StoryA, only include StoryA in the list one time.

After completing Problem 10, run the file ps7_test.py. All the tests should now pass.

Canopy specific instructions:Every time you modify code inps7.pygo to
Run -> Restart Kernel (or hit the CTRL with the dot on your keyboard)
before running ps7_test.py. You have to do this every time you modify the fileps7.pyand want to run the fileps7_test.py, otherwise changes to the former will not be incorporated in the latter.

Also after completing Problem 10, you can try running ps7.py, and various RSS news items should pop up, filtered by some hard-coded triggers defined for you in some code near the bottom. The code runs an infinite loop, checking the RSS feed for new stories every 60 seconds. Press "Exit" at the bottom of the popup window to exit out of the program.

Note: In addition to the function filterStories, please provide your definitions of WordTrigger, TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, SummaryTrigger, and PhraseTrigger in the following box.

PART 4: USER-SPECIFIED TRIGGERS
-------------------------------
Right now, your triggers are specified in your Python code, and to change them, you have to edit your program. This is very user-unfriendly. (Imagine if you had to edit the source code of your web browser every time you wanted to add a bookmark!)

Instead, we want you to read your trigger configuration from a triggers.txt file every time your application starts, and use the triggers specified there.

Consider the following example trigger configuration file:
    # subject trigger named t1
    t1 SUBJECT world

    # title trigger named t2
    t2 TITLE Intel

    # phrase trigger named t3
    t3 PHRASE New York City

    # composite trigger named t4
    t4 AND t2 t3

    # the trigger set contains t1 and t4
    ADD t1 t4

The example file specifies that four triggers should be created, and that two of those triggers should be added to the trigger list:

A trigger that fires when a subject contains the word 'world' (t1).

A trigger that fires when the title contains the word 'Intel' and the news item contains the phrase 'New York City' somewhere (t4).

The two other triggers (t2 and t3) are created but not added to the trigger set directly. They are used as arguments for the composite AND trigger's definition (t4).

Each line in this file does one of the following:
    is blank
    is a comment (begins with a #)
    defines a named trigger
    adds triggers to the trigger list.
    Each type of line is described below.
    Blank: blank lines are ignored. A line that consists only of whitespace is a blank line.

Comments: Any line that begins with a # character is ignored.

Trigger definitions: Lines that do not begin with the keyword ADD define named triggers. The first element in a trigger definition is the name of the trigger. The name can be any combination of letters without spaces, except for "ADD". The second element of a trigger definition is a keyword (e.g., TITLE, PHRASE, etc.) that specifies the kind of trigger being defined. The remaining elements of the definition are the trigger arguments. What arguments are required depends on the trigger type:
    TITLE : a single word.
    SUBJECT : a single word.
    SUMMARY : a single word.
    NOT : the name of the trigger that will be NOT'd.
    AND : the names of the two other triggers that will be AND'd.
    OR : the names of the two other triggers that will be OR'd.
    PHRASE : a phrase.

Trigger addition: A trigger definition should create a trigger and associate it with a name but should not automatically add that trigger to the running trigger list. One or more ADD lines in the .txt file will specify which triggers should be in the trigger list. An addition line begins with the ADD keyword. Following ADD are the names of one or more previously defined triggers. These triggers will be added to the the trigger list.

PROBLEM 11
We have implemented the function readTriggerConfig(filename) for you. We've written code to open the file and throw away all the lines that don't begin with instructions (e.g. comments and blank spaces), and then reads in the code that defines triggers and instantiates the triggers by making a call to the helper function makeTrigger. The function readTriggerConfig then returns a list of triggers specified in the configuration file.

First, read through the definition of readTriggerConfig. You should be able to understand everything this function is doing at this point in the course.

Next, implement the function makeTrigger(triggerMap, triggerType, params, name). This helper function should build and return a trigger depending on its type. It also keeps track of triggers and names in a map. We have defined for you the specifications for this function to make it easier for you to write. Be sure you understand how readTriggerConfig is using this function; that will make implementation easier.

Once that's done, modify the code within the function main_thread to use the trigger list specified in your configuration file, instead of the one we hard-coded for you:
    # TODO: Problem 11
    # After implementing makeTrigger, uncomment the line below:
    # triggerlist = readTriggerConfig("triggers.txt")

    NOTE that you may have to change "triggers.txt" to the full
    filepath (eg, C:/Documents/triggers.txt) if the 
    RSS reader window does not pop up. You can reset Canopy with 
    Run -> Restart Kernel or CTRL key with the dot key.
      
After completing Problem 11, you can try running ps7.py, and depending on how your triggers.txt file is defined, various RSS news items should pop up for easy reading. The code runs an infinite loop, checking the RSS feed for new stories every 60 seconds.

Hint: If no stories are popping up, open up triggers.txt and change the triggers to ones that reflect current events (if you don't keep up, just pick a trigger that would fire on one of the current Google news [http://news.google.com/] stories).

Hint: You may find the str.join (http://goo.gl/rf13bq) useful.
