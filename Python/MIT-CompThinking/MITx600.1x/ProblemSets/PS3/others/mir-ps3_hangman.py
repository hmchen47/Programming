    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many 
      letters the secretWord contains.
    * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess 
      about whether their guess appears in the computers word.
    * After each round, you should also display to the user the 
      partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the 
      user has not yet guessed.
