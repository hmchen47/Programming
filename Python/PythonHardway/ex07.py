Study Drills
1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of 
    mistake you made.
4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to 
    make them in this new one.
5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool 
    everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They 
    make mistakes all the time.

Typically you'll use single-quotes for any short strings like 'a' or 'snow'.
