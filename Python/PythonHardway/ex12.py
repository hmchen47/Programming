Study Drills
1. In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc raw_input. 
    Read what it says. If you're on Windows try python -m pydoc raw_input instead.
2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.
3. Look online for what the pydoc command does.
4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you do not 
    understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things.
