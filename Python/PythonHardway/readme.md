Next Steps
----------
- [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) You will learn even more about programming as you learn more programming languages, so try learning Ruby too.
- [The Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/) and try to build a web application with the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) if you're into science, math, and engineering and also [Dexy](http://dexy.it/) for when you want to write awesome papers that incorporate SciPy or any code really.
- [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) and see if you can make a game with graphics and sound.
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for doing data manipulation and analysis.
- [Natural Language Tool Kit](http://nltk.org/) for analyzing written text and writing things like spam filters and chat bots.
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) to learn the client side of HTTP and the web.
- [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org/) to play with making your computer see things in the real world.
- [ScraPy](http://scrapy.org/) and try scraping some web sites to get information off them.
- [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) for doing 3D graphic and games.
- [Kivy](http://kivy.org/) for doing user interfaces on desktops and mobile platforms.
- [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning applications.
- [Ren'Py](http://renpy.org/) for doing interactive fiction games, similar to what you've built in this book but with pictures.
- [Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/) after you're familiar with Python and try learning C and algorithms with my other book. Take it slow; C is different but a very good thing to learn.
