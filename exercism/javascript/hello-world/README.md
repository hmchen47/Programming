# Hello World

Write a function that greets the user by name, or by saying "Hello, World!" if no name is given.

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.

**Note:** You can skip this exercise by running:

    exercism skip $TRACK_ID hello-world

## Specification

Write a `Hello World!` function that can greet someone given their name.  The
function should return the appropriate greeting.

For an input of "Alice", the response should be "Hello, Alice!".

If a name is not given, the response should be "Hello, World!"

## Test-Driven Development

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we simulate [Test-Driven
Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where
you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in
the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved
the problem.

It will also provide you with a safety net to explore other solutions without
breaking the functionality.

### A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. Submit your solution (`exercism submit /path/to/file`)

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's
also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and
readable as we can. However, solutions to the hello-world exercise will not be
reviewed by a person, but by rikki- the robot, who will offer an encouraging
word.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine-node .

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.


## Tutorial

This exercise has two files:

- hello-world.js
- hello-world.spec.js

The first file is where you will write your code.
The second is where the tests are defined.

The tests will check whether your code is doing the right thing.
You don't need to be able to write a test suite from scratch,
but it helps to understand what a test looks like, and what
it is doing.

Open up the test file, hello-world.spec.js.
It has three tests defined in it.

This is the first test:

    it('says hello world with no name', function() {
      expect(helloWorld.hello('')).toEqual('Hello, World!');
    });

Run the test now, with the following command on the command-line:

    jasmine-node .

The test fails, which makes sense since you've not written any code yet.

The failure looks like this:

    1) Hello World says hello world with no name
       Message:
          Expected undefined to equal 'Hello, World!'.

There's more, but this is the most important part.

Take a look at that first line:

    1) Hello World says hello world with no name

Now look at the test definition again:

    it('says hello world with no name', function() {
      // ... more code here ...
    });

The text 'says hello world with no name' is repeated.
This is how you know which test failed.

The failure message explains what is wrong:

    Expected undefined to equal 'Hello, World!'.

This comes from the part of the test definition that says "expect":

    expect(helloWorld.hello('')).toEqual('Hello, World!');

It's comparing two values. It is calling

    helloWorld.hello('')

and comparing the result to a hard-coded string.

    'Hello, World!'.

So if you look at the failure message again, the hello function
is returning undefined.

Try changing the function in hello-world.js so that it says

    HelloWorld.prototype.hello = function(input) {
        return "chocolate";
    };

Then run the tests again from the command-line:

    jasmine-node .

Notice how it changes the failure message.

Then change the implementation in hello-world.js again, this time to make the test pass.

Once the test is passing, look at the second test in hello-world.spec.js. It looks like this:

    xit('says hello to bob', function() {
      expect(helloWorld.hello('Bob')).toEqual('Hello, Bob!');
    });

This test starts with `xit` instead of `it`.
That means that when jasmine-node runs the tests,
the test will be skipped.

Change the test so that it starts with `it`,
and run the tests again.

Make the test pass, and then do the same with the third test.

When you are done, submit your solution to exercism:

    exercism submit hello-world.js
